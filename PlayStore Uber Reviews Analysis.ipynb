      "I had an accident with an Uber driver in Mexico City. The car that I got into had no side mirror. The Brakes were not working properly either. I almost got into an accident twice. The driver's conversation was unpleasant. Being a foreigner he was very curious to ask where I am from and what brought me to Mexico. I replied to be a tourist and through that conversation is over. He became very rude and asked me if I came to look for a Mexican husband. I never answered and kept quiet. He took the wrong route and made several in requested stops. Having in mind it was uberX. He continued asked me whom I sleep with. He literally stopped the car and asked me to wait for him text someone. I asked him to let me go and take a different driver but he locked the doors and didn't allow me. \n",
      "I have had my account completely hacked to where I cannot sign in or view it. Someone spent over $1k in Uber rides on my credit and debit cards linked to the account and when I dialed the only number available (safety line) I was told I would need to wait until another department emailed me. I didn't hear anything for almost 24 hours and when I did it was a prompted message that did not help at all. It has been almost 2 days and I still have no received a phone call or any helpful support via email. This is a nightmare and the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I am going to be filing a police report to the person who myself and the driver caught fraudulently using my account and looking into an attorney for Uber not making identity theft a priority and rectifying the situation on their end.\n",
      "I requested an 8 mile ride in Boston on a Saturday night around 1:00 am that was coming up around $55 on the app and Lyft was around the same rate. Ended up taking a regular cab that cost me $20. Beware of high rates.\n",
      "I've been driving off and on with the company since 2016. Since I have been driving in a new place, I noticed Uber is taking more than 50% of the fare. A passenger paid $7.52. Uber took $4.52 and just gave me $3. I have driven for 13 hours and not even paid $100. Majority (99.9%) of my fares never hit $7. Where I was making over a $200 a day, now it's $60, $70 maybe $90. And don't forget to tack on a full tank of gas which is over $30 for my car. And the maintenance upkeep that I accrue more quickly because of rideshare. I will never drive nor think about riding for or with them again.\n",
      "Uber is overcharging for Toll fees. When In Florida the Tolls fees estimates between $ .75 to $ 2.00. Uber price shown will be Example $ 16.73 for the ride. After you take the ride you get charge 28.23 and when you check the account it's telling you that you got charge for Tolls. The driver never took the toll route and you try to contact Uber company and they take long to get back to you about the issue of being overcharge. I try to email them and let them know about the extra charges and why am I being charge for a service that I didn't receive.\n",
      "I had an airport flight today. Uber would not accept my credit card, my Venmo, or my PayPal. As a last resort I brought an Uber gift card to cover my ride to the airport. I'll be damned the Uber App wouldn't even accept their own gift card. My daughter downloaded three of her cards to her app to buy me a ride and sure enough they wouldn't accept her cards either. As a last resort she brought me a ride from Lift with no problem. I'm sending Uber back their gift card certified mail and demanding a refund. After much stress I barely made my flight. I'm also deleting Uber's App and will never, ever use them again. Laura\n",
      "I worked for Uber and Lyft for 2.5 years and all they did was take take take from the drivers who ate mostly foreign laborers here illegally and are afraid to fight back against corporate crime. Wage theft. Like you wouldn't believe. Don't do any Gig Economy job. The government needs labor regulations. The state of California is setting the example by fighting them!\n",
      "In July of this year I had sushi delivered to me in Mexico by UberEats, a subsidiary of Uber, on five occasions. The total cost was 1,918 pesos -- about $100 US. However, I was billed $1,919 dollars(!) on my credit card; something I discovered at the end of the month when paying my credit cards. I contacted Uber Customer Support (Uber does not provide any number to call, so all customer service work has to be through the via email messaging) and I was told that, due this was a glitch in the app and my charges would be refunded.\n",
      "My driver, Rohan was nice, but when I tried to add tip I noticed that he had switched my $9 9am fare in French Quarter to someone else's 2pm trip in Metairie for $28.00! UBER refused to acknowledge. 5 attempts to rectify problem and received nothing but irrelevant automated replies. If you get in the car with Rohan in NOLA and he says he can't get his system to work, it's a a SCAM. Terrible customer service from UBER with zero relevant assistance after 7 days of requesting corrected bill. BEWARE.\n",
      "I had seven fraudulent Uber transactions over three days in mid-October on my credit card. For nearly a week, I tried unsuccessfully to get Uber customer service to help. Uber was totally uncooperative. They refused to engage in the fraudulent charges someone in their system imposed on me. I had to cancel my credit card, get a new credit card and leave my credit card company to battle awful Uber. Uber buyer beware. I know I will never use their services again.\n",
      "Our driver never showed up and Uber cancelled our ride, not us. They charged us a cancellation fee for them cancelling. When I disputed it they would only credit it on future ride instead of refund back to our credit card. Why am I only getting a credit on account instead of a full refund to my credit card used?? This is not right what you have done when it was a Uber error.\n",
      "When the service worked, it was good, and tech support responds quickly most of the time. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the problems I encountered. The app rejected my credit card and offered no explanation as to why. For some reason it accepted my PayPal even though it uses the very card the app had just rejected. It took days of back and forth with tech support to find out that my card \"isn't compatible with their system\", but they refused to be more specific than that and no matter how many times I asked what the exact problem was (ie my bank, the type of card, etc) all they did was rephrase the same answer over and over again with canned responses; repeatedly telling me to check w/ my bank, even after I told them I already had done so.\n",
      "Being a responsible driver, I made the decision to use Uber after a few drinks at a local cantina. My friends and I live within a couple miles of each other, so we shared the Uber. I was the second person to be dropped off and my sole set of keys (i.e. car, house, storage, work) fell out of my pocket. I realized I had left them in the backseat almost immediately, but had no way to contact the driver bc, unfortunately, my friend was the one who ordered the ride. My friend contacted him the next day (that was a feat within itself bc Uber drivers are extremely protected), but did not receive a response.\n",

      "I have been punished for circumstances beyond my control. I have asked repeatedly for someone to tell me what I have done wrong or could have done differently and no one will talk to me about it. You see, I am a driver for Ubereats, and I loved it until Friday night when I had several orders not completed due to circumstances outside of my control. 2 orders could not be delivered because the restaurant wasn't serving the items at that time. \n",
      "Don't use it, that's my recommendation!. I ordered uber, selected the car to come and pick me up , got the confirmation that Musa (driver) is coming in 14 min (price selected was 11-14EUR). Guess what 15 min later got another message that another driver is coming in 25 min.. He came after 27 min and charged me 17.5EUR +3.50EUR extra for the time....? So, he came late and i'm charged extra for this time.... I need to mention as well that i was going to hospital to change my cast, as i have a broken leg and i'm in crutches; moreover was poring rain outside.... When i got teh invoice after i'ev been charges, i sent an email, over and over again , nobody have any reply. I called them few times, and left voice messages (as nobody ever picks up the phone), no call bank nor reply until now, over 3 weeks has passed already. Don't use it, you have nobody to complain to in case the driver is rude or even offensive, and they just charge you whatever they wish, always EXTRA, never less\n",
      "Upfront pricing not true pricing. Uber pads the bill so much. I've had Uber drivers charge for wait time when they are parked down from my house and I am out on my front porch waiting and watching them. Booking fee $3.05 come on! Toll and surcharges plus time and distance charges. Now they are dropping me off a few blocks from my destination saying they got to take another call. Uber drivers that I have used have showed up at my house wanting a hookup. One driver started groping me on my front porch. Uber customer service is a brick wall. Credited me $3.00 on a ride on Uber Cash. No matter what they do or charge they have an excuse and they are right. When I reported the sexual harassment of the two drivers they suspended my account. They cost more than a taxi and a taxi never has told me to get out and walk the rest of the way. \n",

He kept touching her, rubbing his hand on her leg. She clung to her backpack praying she would get home safe.She is happily married with a child. She does not invite advancements from men in any way.

      "Drive with Uber you need to get better. I currently drive for Uber but am concerned with some drivers taking advantage of people with disabilities. I had picked up a Uber customer who had a 3 star rating, which to me I thought there was something wrong but still decided to accept the ride. When I picked up the gentleman I realized he was blind. As he got in my car we had a conversation and he told me that I was the quickest pick up he has ever gotten and asked me why. He told me he usually has to keep requesting Ubers over and over. I know why. It's because the drivers are declining a 3 star rider. I told him it was because I don't pass up any opportunities to pick people up to get them to their destination. He was the most kindest man I have ever met and I realized that other drivers have given him low ratings just because he had a disability.\n",
      "Uber quoted me a fare of Ã‚Â£14. Their driver turned up late, took a very long route, got lost and then charged me nearly Ã‚Â£35. I complained and they reduced it to Ã‚Â£26.

      "Driver was fine and so was ride. Experience of dealing with getting a coupon for first ride had me looking for a human being to talk to, and was amazed to find there was no one. I think they charge enough to hire customer service of some kind. I couldn't even find a human online.\n",
      "I called uber for going home two days ago and yesterday they charged me extra 40$ even no one told me reason. Then I contacted uber and they told me driver complained me about I was drunk or something else they sent me stupid pictures. I didn't understand exactly what happened but I just called uber and went home even I didn't talk to driver and went home. How come no one asked me anything and they just charged me 40$ directly. I will take my money back and I will delete uber.\n",
      "This is the email I tried to send back to uber after getting a welcome email saying how easy it was to get help (complete fabrication): the email was waiting after I got home a few days after the uber-disasterHi,Well, my attempted first trip was an absolute disaster!!1. The app did not get my current address right, and didn't want me to alter the house number. Even so, I actually wanted it to leave from a few doors down. When I finally got it to accept the new house number, it would not let me enter the suburb.2. After entering the destination, it said it would not give me a quote until AFTER I had entered credit card details. I thought this would be OK, since I'd seen estimated costs at a bit over $1 per km. But it wanted to charge me well over $900!!!!! (the trip should have been about $60, from similar trips by others). There was no obvious way to cancel, just confirm, so I closed the app thinking it would cancel .3. I re-entered the app to try the trip again. But even though I had NOT confirmed the previous attempt, it said I could not enter a trip as one was already booked for the same time.4, There was no obvious way to cancel the trip, not any way to ring or email uber to get it fixed.5. Did some searching, seems there is no way to handle emergency fixes. Utter shame on you. Many others have had similar experiences in being unable to contact anyone when something went wrong.6. Finally found a site explaining how to cancel future trips, hidden in a side menu, which I did, fortunately before the exorbitant charge was taken from my bank.Until I get over this really bad experience with your obvious complete disdain for users, and your really, really terrible app design, I will tell everybody I meet to stay away from uber, the uber-bad transport option. And intend never to use it again myself, unless something changes.\n",
      "Cherry picker???? Asks you where exactly you are going after he picks the order, asks if the lady is going alone, calculates if it is good money and company, then cancels the trip if it is not. You cant review him since the trip hasn't started, so he has pretty nice rate level. Happened to me, not sure how many people he has innocently questioned like that and cancelled the order.\n",
      "Uber in the Southwestern corner of AZ has increased the prices by 11% and are keeping anywhere from 40 to 60% of the fare. Charging for a longer distance but send the driver the shortest. Lyft has con up by 6% and is still cheaper than uber.\n",
      "I ordered myself for a ride about 10 blocks away from my home to a restaurant knowing I would be consuming alcohol. They offered me a discounted ride to walk to the corner of my block for pickup. I agreed to that. Once I confirmed my ride, I was notified I would be dropped off about 4 blocks away from the restaurant. I never agreed to that. That part was not advertised. That area is unsafe being is next to a highway ramp with no crosswalks or traffic signals to get to my destination. So I immediately canceled the ride. \n",

      "Uber one minute gave me a quote of $50 on a ride I needed. A kind family member helped me to pay for it by purchasing an Uber gift card for me. As soon as I loaded the gift card onto my account, I brought the same ride up in app--and now, not 10 minutes later, it showed $63! Just to see if this was due to surge pricing, I tried the same ride in Lyft. It was $50--the same price Uber had quoted me before I loaded the Uber gift card.\n",

They did that again shortly afterwards.Never download this damned Uber App!! Their Refund Claim is a joke. It was very time consuming e-mailing them back and forth with a ZERO- result.

USE CABIFY, EASY TAXI_x000D_GET OUT OF ARGENTINA - GO AWAY UBER - YOUR SERVICE IS NEVER NEEDED AGAIN. _x000D_A few months ago I had a driver who was driving and talking on his cell. I had a year old baby and was stunned that he did that. I contacted Uber customer service..... they dont have customer service. I still had to pay the driver and they didnt FINE him a FEE!!! A month ago my husband, my 2 year old and I were trying to get the the hospital. My son was sick as a dog with a flu, it was raining cats and dogs so we ordered an Uber. The uber driver decided to pick us up 2 blocks away from our house. When my husband explained we had a kid sick, its raining so no please come to our location.... the driver was utterly belligerent, rude, nasty so we cancelled our trip. We got charged a cancellation fee. We have ordered drivers on a regular basis from our house to a train station and without fail almost ALL UBER DRIVERS cancel our rides so we end up waiting an extra 10 - 15 minutes for a replacement. My son has been late to school over and over again because of these Uber drivers. Uber will not give me a refund for the cancellation. I have had many friends use Uber and all have cancelled their accounts due to the lack of service, lack of morals, lack of respect.\n",
      "While I enjoy using Uber for traveling the convenience is nice to have.  While most of the drivers are friendly it's really only convenient in down town areas where you don't have to travel far.  I'd use them for work but it would be quite costly for a daily convenience. I work partial swing and I'm not sure who would be up at 1 am to get me home.  They only send 5 star drivers out.  I would love to dock a star to some drivers that have really filthy cars but if their car is their income source you can't.  There's really no way to leave feed back about that either.I never let an Uber driver pick us up at our house. I wait at the main drag to the complex entrance.  I've heard too many Uber drivers heading back and robbing the place.  I found Uber is really only convenient for traveling around a big city. If you are outside of the city it costs a bit more.  We have used them for trips and they were wonderful.  No communication, no worrying about tips and no chance of being dropped off at the wrong location due to the language barrier.  The app does all that for you and all you do is tap for a pick up request. Thank god for Google Maps.I prefer them over our local taxi cab drivers as most of them scare the hell out of us. Local taxi cab drives drive insanely fast, do unethical/safe maneuvers while driving, or turn the meter off (which is illegal in any state) and start shouting flat fee rates.  If this ever happens to you ask them to let you out where you are.  If they're an ass about the whole situation don't even pay them and contact their supervisor immediately to the company they are with.  This by US state law it is illegal to turn off the meter at any point a passenger is in the vehicle.  Report them to their manager after they leave. Request an uber or lyft service instead.\n",

The upfront fare they showed is 40.50 for economy ride and they said I have an offer of 25% max of 10$ per ride discount so it will be 30.50, then this driver Aashish in Toyota Corolla ** came and literally said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã…Â“Oh I was going home\" and I got a ride which is exactly close to my home that's convenient for him he said and then he took his own favorite route as per his wish and then at the end they charged me 8.96 dollars extra apart from 30.50 saying the toll charges, which means the total fare is 49-50$?? In a non busy period, that is never a fare till now. It's maximum 35-36 and or 38-39 in a busy time. \n",
      "Earlier, Uber was great. They used to provide prompt customer service and quick redressal of issues. Now, there is no person you can speak to, there is no acknowledgement even if you complain and random multiple charges are being deducted for the same trip. Thank God for Ola, otherwise UBER is such a scam.\n",
      "Uber is the worst, they charge for everything.  They allow their drivers to say that they are at the destination so that the customer is charged a waiting fee.  I was literally waiting on the driver outside for 7 minutes because he was at the wrong complex and i get charged a waiting fee.  To top it off uber allows their drivers to text and drive. I sent the pics to uber, and they stated that it is not a cause to be alarmed. I have more, but it keeps freezing when i upload more pics. Alot of the uber drivers are rude and uber doesnt care.

      "I have been using Uber as a rider from 2016 with a good passenger rating. Never had issues with any driver and my experience was in general good. A month ago Uber disabled my account. I reached customer support and after a few email exchanges, customer support sent me a rude (and offensive) email that I have violated the terms and conditions. I can safely say that this is truth challenged. I have no duplicate accounts, I am quiet as a rider and cooperative and never caused any issues. I asked customer support if there is a mistake and if they can lift the suspension but they ignored my request. This is no way to treat a client. Uber deals with problems because it cannot handle the vast clientele it has currently and makes mistakes, but this is no way to treat someone like this. I believe that TLC should investigate further how Uber is operating in terms of customer support, as well as monitor it much closer.\n",

We arrived the day before, The suggestion from our travel agent, just to make sure that nothing went wrong.We are new to Uber and our ride from the Comfort Inn Suites at the New Orleans airport to the Port of New Orleans on Feb 7 was the first time using Uber.  This was at the suggestion of the Comfort Inn Suite and we were happy with the service that was provided to the Port of New Orleans. Mileage of 14.34 and drive time of 36 minutes as recorded with a value of $21.78. On our travel from the Best Western Plus on St Charles Ave to the Louis Armstrong airport on Feb 19 was a total of 15.77 miles and a trip time of 31 minutes and with a fare charge of (adjusted by Uber from $44.11) $39.07 is still $17.29 more than our first ride with only a difference of 1.43 miles and 5 minutes. It took two weeks to get a response back from Uber. This is unprofessional.  We had explained in detail on the cost of all three of our trips with Uber, and the last trip, we where over charged, due to the driver taking a longer route. Plus the driver was on the phone with his wife when driving.  In Louisiana, law prohibits talking on your phone while driving, that is called \"Distracted Driving\" and the driver put us in harms way and insurance companies like to hear about this when it comes to distracted drivers.    We said that I will call both Hotels, and complain, we also said that I will get a hold of Uber Head Office, plus go on social media, and do a negative review, plus do a negative review on the Uber app.  My husband and I are very upset on how this has been handled, with the Uber company in New Orleans to a point that they stop returning emails, even with the Uber app.That is a very expensive 1.43 miles and 5 minute ride. The first refund proposed by Uber was $.29 we find to be a joke and totally inadequate and we were hoping that Uber would reconsider a more substantial refund.  They have refunded us so far around $10.  When checking the distance to the airport it should've been $28.00.  Since then we have not heard from Uber. Specially with the last email asking for the email for head office.So we are done with the games, will be posting this note on all social media to let everybody know be aware of Uber ripping customers off and for their safety. Plus we will also be placing this on the website of the hotels that we were staying at.This could've been prevented if they communicated with us and reimbursed us the difference which they did not I guess money is more important than having a customer base._x000D_Josie and Gordon\n",
      "I took Uber from IGT 1 to Sector 25 Noida and it shows rent of 820 approx. on Uber Premier, which looks good but when I reached my location without any stoppage driver asked me to pay 1210 rupees which is totally disappointing for me as prepaid taxi outside airport is even charging 950 rupees. But when I cross checked with my trip charges then I was shocked to see billing of 835 is showing on my app. I asked the driver to talk to Uber and check the same but he refused and asked to pay his charge as per his Uber application and write mail to Uber for the claim. I do took pictures of driver's mobile application screen and there is no transaction or reference number to track. Only amount, date, location is shown in it and same is with my trip detail in my Uber app. When trying to download receipt of this trip it's not opening as Uber Lite is not supporting this function.

      "I was in Montreal last week as it was raining. Wanted a quick ride to my destination so booked an Uber. The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Uber doesn't tell you the amount right away. You don't have the visibility as you do in most cabs. You can see the meter and make a quick decision of either taking the ride or stopping it right away.\n",

I fired Uber, and will never use them again.\n",

Going to and from the airport, events and other places I want to go but don't want to hassle with finding parking or walking through acres of parking lot after I've arrived.  Love the convenience of being picked up and dropped of right at the front door and I've had such nice experiences with meeting the most kind and positive Uber drivers. I've been around for a long time and am glad there is a service like this now. Sometimes I am afraid to go here or there because I'm concerned I'll get lost but with Uber I no longer worry and just go! One more thing.... ** If you want to sign up with coupon code jodir282ue you can get up to $20 off your first ride. **\n",
      "2 fraudulent trips on bank acct. Called Uber. Support only available thru app. I don't do data. Went to website. First time ever. My email was already in use. Used forgot password option 3 times. They sent LINK to reset password. I used it. Then a 4 digit code was required to complete password change. There was NO code in ANY of my emails from them. Can't sign in. Can't try to get my money back from the fraud. Bank still to investigate, but they had advised me to call Uber about it in case their investigation (claim) provided no results for me. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!\n",
      "I take pride in driving, that is why I am quitting today. During drive time I may pick up a lawyer, a wink, a prostitute or kids that need a diaper change or a random person who doesn't bath. My cars are cleaned 5 times a day and I carry spray. So for a guest in my car to say I need deodorizer that's rude. If I am driving through a green light and it turns yellow one cannot stop in the middle of the street. There is a reason a passenger doesn't have a car. Uber never asks the driver about the passenger reports, so I am quitting. I will never give one of these passengers a ride anywhere in my car. Uber cheats drivers daily, they only hire Asian customer service reps, and the guy who works at the San Bernardino green light is a huge ** who wears a sweater and basketball shorts. If you do not drive 12 hours the dispatch punishes drivers with 2.00 fares for up to six hours. That's why they are being sued for unfair practices.\n",
      "My first experience did not go well. I'm in Waikiki and needed a ride from a hotel to a restaurant for a scheduled luncheon. The app worked well and the driver was to arrive in 3 minutes. There were pick-up time adjustments as the 3 minutes passed and 15 minutes elapsed. We are now late for the luncheon when a text is received from the driver that he cancelled our ride. A new Uber request is sent and a driver dispatched with a, \"be there in 3 minutes.\" No Uber after 6 minutes; however, the driver telephoned to indicate she was lost but should arrive soon. We stayed in touch by phone discussing her locations location as updates were provide. The car finally arrived and on our way to the luncheon arriving 50 minutes late. My return to the hotel from the restaurant went well.\n",
      "I booked an Uber ride and the driver immediately accepted the trip. The app showed me that the driver is very close to my starting point, but I could not find him anywhere. Then within seconds I received a notification saying that I am in the trip and will arrive at my destination soon. But I was still waiting at my starting point waiting for the driver to arrive. I wrote to the driving asking him where he is. No reply, and I could see him moving towards my destination.\n",
      "Apparently, it must be an easy way for Drivers (and Uber) in the Miami, Florida area to make a quick buck without working, as I was hit with not one, not two, not three, but SEVEN bogus charges within the span of 2 weeks. The game apparently works like this: you request a ride, the driver accepts the ride request, the driver gets near the pickup spot, cancels the request, charges your card for the cancellation (hoping you never notice the charge), then goes on to his/her next victim in the area.\n",
      "I am a long standing rider with Uber, had better and worse experiences, but recently I was shocked by them. I rode with my mom and my mom opened a bottle of club soda, basically water with gas in it, and it spilled a bit. She apologized and cleaned it, but it is water after all. When you step into a car from the rain, you bring water in... We were charged with 80$(!!) cleaning fee. I sent them pictures of what they called the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã…Â“messÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã‚Â along with pictures the bottle in question. They still insisted on charging 20$ fee for cleaning water... And here I thought water IS a cleaning agent and not something to be cleaned.\n",
      "So, it had been a while since I visited New York City. At LaGuardia Airport I wanted a cab to get to my destination in Brooklyn and the Yellow Cab drivers refused to take me. I had truly forgotten how racist the Yellow cab drivers were in NYC. BUT! Thank GOODNESS for Uber! Downloaded the app, got my ride and used Uber my entire stay in NYC. TO HELL WITH THE YELLOW CABS! UBER IS THE GREATEST!\n",
      "I am a senior citizen and I tried to sign up for Uber. I went to the website to create an account. I supplied my name, an email address, a cell phone # and password. Afterward, I realized I had not used the correct email address. Thus began a vicious cycle. When I tried to change the email address, it said the phone # I provided was already in use. It kept asking me to send a screenshot of my phone. I have no idea how or what that entails. I could not find a phone # or customer service agent. There was nowhere to go to complete the transaction. I ended up going to GogoGrandparent through Lyft, but I would prefer Uber.\n",
      "Very convenient/useful/good to have and important if you don't own your own car or can drive. The prices are suprisingly very affordable. I will definitely never call or take a taxi ever again lol. Everytime I have used Uber before, they are usually there and show up within 15 minutes of me submitting the order. You can watch the driver in live time they the map on the Uber app so you know where he is and how far\n",
      "I called for a ride. A woman jumped in the car and they drove off despite me showing him that it was me who called. I was then charged for the ride. I complained and the fare was refunded. I was also charged a flat fee of $6.95, which they refuse to refund. Why would I be charged when it was the driver's error?! They have ignored my emails of course. I will NEVER use Uber again! I'll stick with cabs or Lyft.\n",
      "I was transported by Uber a few times by the VA. Sometimes they were on time, sometimes not. I only had one bad experience with them, and was a rude driver. He didn't seem to want to take me at all. I'm sure the VA paid good money to transport me, but he was just real unfriendly.\n",
      "I have asked several times from the tech support team   \" where would I go to print up ALL_x000D_my receipts with Uber......Uber wants to charge me $1.00 join a service for that fee_x000D_THAT IS RIDICULOUS AND CHEAP OF THEM_x000D_THUMBS DOWN UBER   ZERO RATING FOR YOU\n",
      "At late night hour Uber driver after accepting my trip drops me midway in a deserted parking and threatened me as my trip was booked on online payment and he wanted cash. The follow ups with Uber and their responses have been appalling. On asking for driver contact details for registering a Police complaint they are denying it on account of privacy issue and sharing the car's name plate, an Information that I am sharing in my every conversation and complaint. As a company #Uber is more concerned about protecting the interests of their Driver Partner but not keen in safeguarding the safety of their Customer.\n",
      "I requested an Uber as I usually do and the trip went very good. As soon as I reached my destination, a friend opened the door for me to help me with my Bags. I always look back to see if I forget anything, and I didn't, and my friend didn't see anything wrong with the seats as well. The next day I received an email stating that they are charging me for a cleaning fee of 80 Dollars. There was nothing wrong with the backseats. I tried contacting Uber support but it was worthless. Nobody answers via text and they don't have any customer service number. After this horrible experience I don't trust this company anymore. I will no longer be using uber services for their lack of professionalism, and the accountability of your lousy driver.\n",
      "I usually have good experiences with Uber but this one driver charged us for a cleaning fee, his vehicle was already a mess to begin with. Not sure why Uber doesn't do anything to protect consumers about these kinds of charges. We didn't bring anything with us or did we have any food or any accidents in the vehicle.\n",
      "I used to absolutely love Uber and took daily trips to and from but I swear this year both Uber and Lyft's prices have skyrocket. Even riding pool has gone up tremendously. It's crazy that people have now decided to pay co workers weekly to carpool with them rather than get an Uber. More people are going to go back to trains and buses in order to save money to get to and from work. Either that, or go ahead and get a car because you'll end up paying a car payment anyway riding daily with this company if not more.\n",
      "An Uber driver was parked in a van with his door open waiting for a customer to come out. My son asked this driver to call 911 because there was a girl running around trying to stab him and his friends. This driver refused to call 911. Then this girl and a guy with a hoody on came up to my son and the guy stabbed my son in the neck and ran off. This Uber driver was still sitting there when this occurred. My son was on the ground holding his neck and blood was rushing out and he again asked your driver to please call 911. This Uber driver once again refused. \n",
      "Feedback about the booking fee. Recently Uber started to charge a so-called booking fee, claiming that this is to support one of a sudden safety initiatives. What am I getting from your safety initiatives? Just another trick to charge customers more. Would love to see the list of Uber initiates they currently do for passengers. Also, there is no transparency about the fee. It should be added to the estimated cost of a trip before a customer orders rather than in a sneaky way of adding after the fact. Just very frustrating because such a reputable company like Uber make its customer feel like fools.\n",
      "Uber steals what little drivers make and puts the money in their fat pockets. Doesn't even come close to making minimum wage. Uber is too busy stealing from drivers while reducing their pairing. They control your earnings and steal 40% waste of time, money and gas. You'll drive around more looking for trips than you would actually driving passenger. If you complain Uber retaliates. Uber has made numerous changes to drivers earnings while they collect all the profit including the pools that should count multiple passengers towards your quest. Instead only counts as one trip. You make less than minimum wage and isn't even worth carpooling to work. Drivers are going on strike for a reason because Uber steals from them. Waiting two hours for a passenger nothing. It's not even worth it carpooling to work.\n",
      "Uber has been nothing but a headache since I started working for them. I take a 1 hour drive and they take the money away from me saying that I picked up the wrong person from a specific household to a business. Please tell me what the likelihood of me picking up someone from a house and go in one hour away to a business and we picking up the wrong person is.... Oh you say it makes no damn sense, yeah you're right. Smfh. Uber takes no time whatsoever to do any sort of investigation not even an email to find out anything at all from the driver. They just send an email saying that they took your money and you wasted your time. This is not the only nonsense that I have had to deal with. A customer broke the handle of my car and there was a huge run around with handling that. I will no longer be driving with this unprofessional company and I will be taking legal action.\n",
      "My friend referred me to open an Uber account, and I received a C$10 promotional discount. I took Uber from Pearson Airport T1 to Dufferin and Steeles area on May 19. The upfront price was C$30.78, the final price was C$37.66, and I took screenshots of both. I wrote to Uber and attached the two screenshot pictures. I was advised by Uber that there is a C$2.75 for booking Fee, and C$4.50 for Airport Surcharge, and Uber replied as follow: \"The estimated amount of the toll or surcharge is included in your upfront price before taking a trip. On this trip, your actual route included roads with tolls or surcharges that were not accounted for in your predicted route and your upfront price was adjusted.\" \n",
      "If I could rate this experience any lower, I would. This was my first and last trip with Uber. My credit card was charged $33.60 for the trip to my destination, and $113.62 for the return trip. I contacted Uber and they would not refund the overcharge. This is certainly no way to run a business and no way to treat their customers. Terrible experience. Next time I will call a cab. Attached are photos of my receipts.\n",
      "I moved back to Huntsville, Alabama in May of 2019. I had left in Feb, 2019, and moved to Florida and then Dallas, Texas. I had tried \"Uber\" in Florida and Texas and did pretty well. When I returned to Alabama, I uploaded all of my new driving requirement documents and was held up on one particular document, the 20 point inspection. I went to a certified mechanic and paid for the inspection and my 2017 Camry passed with flying colors. \"Uber\" denied it. I was shocked. \n",
      "Scheduled a ride to the Tampa Airport. Driver never showed up with no notice. Tried to book a ride again but web site couldn't or wouldn't supply a ride. Ended up having to book a regular taxi. Won't count on Uber again!\n",
      "I use Uber when I miss the bus after work sometimes. The last two times it says a reasonable price usually about 8-10 dollars. Then after booking the ride and confirming the flash new price which has been 13-14 dollars. Then it asks if I want to pay 25 dollars to get to pay 9.99 for the ride instead of the 13-14 dollar price. This has happened 3 times now. I'm sorry but I'm not gonna pay 25 bucks so that I can pay another 10 for the ride home. That's ridiculous.\n",
      "Overall a very marvellous travelling facility, with uptodate vehicles and decent partners. Really helping a lot of people on daily basis by saving them from headache of wandering in the streets for taxis and bargaining with the illiterate drivers. thumbs up\n",
      "Do not! Trust or use this company. Uber does not care about their drivers nor the riders. I say this because 1st off. The 3rd party company that they use deny all. To whom may have any past minor traffic or minor offenses that do not concern with felons. I have no major offensive issues and felt with things to get my driver's license back. Been years! Still the 3rd party company will send Uber a red flag and deny all incoming new party meaning new applications for new drivers. They have been reported to many! Different local news agents and states. They also do not care about the drivers. Via YouTube reviews on Uber and the company. \n",
      "I ordered and had to reorder my food again and pay for all food that's were not delivered to me... The delivery guy did not make a real attempt to reach me or ring my bell. And Uber customer service is very bad. No one to talk to!\n",
      "My wife and daughter spent a couple of days in Belfast. They decided to use Uber on the 1st day. Hotel Etap to Primark, journey is roughly 1 mile and had the cheek to charge them ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£14. This is someone taking advantage of 2 women on a break. It took them 10 minutes to walk back to the hotel. Didn't even want to leave the 1 star but you can't give them zero. This behaviour is disgusting.\n",
      "I used to be so happy with Uber until I got a ** driver who decided to scam me by taking a massive detour for some extra bucks even though he was aware at what time my flight was leaving. I was in the car with my baby girl in the car seat trapped on this traffic jammed highway asking him to please stay on route because I needed to catch my plane. Him giving me one ** story after another and keeps driving . By massive detour I mean a ride that usually even with heavy traffic takes an hour max. With his scheme it took me 2,5 hours.\n",
      "All the cabs provided by Uber in India are extremely dirty and have a horrible stench settled in them which mostly comes from the drivers. The mats are literally matted with cakes of dirt and the seat covers are almost always stained. To top it all the drivers are really unprofessional, they refuse to come up on the pickup point and if they don't feel like executing the ride, the driver ends up calling the rider and asks them to cancel the ride. Hence lowering the rating of the rider. I have had extremely bad experience with Uber at multiple times. I have been dropped in the middle of the road by the drivers just because they didn't have an internet connection to check the maps. The drivers are racist as well sexist and on many an occasion have passed very rude and vulgar remarks.\n",
      "It's absolutely horrible experience and felt systematic loot by the corporate whose tariff not controlled by any government authorities. Neither they care for our laws. The charge for Goregaon west to CST RAILWAYS WAS Approx 1000/- INR WHEN I GOT DOWN within 2 km they charged me 230/- as penalty. Is our government protecting our right and controlling unethical business practices of UBER? Disgusting.\n",
      "I have been charged several time for wait time fees. These are fraudulent charges. The 2 charges Uber refunded and now I have another one and they will not refund. How do we get to stop charging fraudulently for a service not received?\n",
      "After continuously reminding that i was charged more by the driver i have not yet got refund nor yet any customer executive is assigned to this matter. It's been four days. I have not received any mail regarding it. It's really difficult to contact Uber as there is no direct call center for customers complaints. We just have to write on Uber help or support but dont get any response from them. I know writing here also will not sort my issue but it's just ridiculous.\n",
      "I was quoted $12 for a 2.8-mile ride that took 11 min and was charged 27.63 on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm. This was their charges: Base Fare $2.10, Time $4.56, Distance $3.30, Normal Fare $9.96, 2nd person $9.96, Waiting Time $ .86, Booking Fee $1.85, Tip $5.00. In what universe? Crooks. Criminals.\n",
      "Months ago, I purchased & loaded an Uber gift card on my Uber app. It then refused to accept the gift card DEMANDING additional credit or debit card... Hi-jacking & holding the money I spent & entered on the app of their official gift card. Months later, I entered a debit card issued by MetaBank in Iowa & it refused to accept it!!! Now, after nearly 2 hours of trying to access my account data, it won't accept my password. After over an hour of trying to reset my password and receiving numerous reset codes from Uber, they still won't allow me access the account! What they're doing is personal data collection of phone number, debit & credit cards, email address & social media accounts. Who's paying them to collect personal data! Sneaky way of personal data collection & robbery at the same time.\n",
      "People have been going on strike since Uber reduced the pay to drivers. It is now about the same as Lyft or a tad better. I am an Uber/Lyft Driver and let me tell you. I hope both of these companies go away. Let riders go back to Taxis days where they never show up or show up rude and disrespectful in unclean cars. Let's see if both of these companies will appreciate drivers and pay them fairly for the HARD work they do. Such as ending up in a place that's 1.5 hours and having to drive 1.5 hour home just for one trip and get pay nothing. They pay is very little to drivers considering gas (how expensive recently and continue rising as of May 13,2019), maintenance every 2-3 months, car depreciation with high mileage each day. Do not bother to go on Strike. Drivers please just GET OFF the road so that there's not many drivers left with no drivers on the road but tons of riders. \n",
      "Rates can be astronomical. Cancellation rates are high. Customer service support, is unhelpful, and most members are hard to understand. Supervisors are not available. Time waiting on hold is beyond substandard. Any issues take 24-48 hours to be resolved, or aren't resolved at all. Money is essentially stolen from passengers, and drivers. Any/all interactions with the company are frustrating, and negative.\n",
      "I use Uber service at least 20 times a month, I was charged for an additional stop that I did not take, when I contacted the help website they were less than helpful. I received a response ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã…Â“the driver's additional stop was justifiedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã‚Â, and I in turn was charged the additional amount. So, I asked 3 times for a refund for the money that I added to my account for future trips that I would be taking, and I never received a response. As a matter of fact the Help Desk kept pinging me without a response. This is not the first time that this has happened, but it's the first time that my money was not refunded; it's the same address every time that Uber adds to my trip.\n",
      "Uber Events no show. Let me start by saying I LOVE Uber. But Uber event didn't work, my guest were unable to use the ride I offered. Also I have no way of contacting Uber to get answers. I have searched online with no luck - support shouldn't be this hard!\n",
      "Uber put my account on a 48 hour hold because I added new info to my account. Uber has not yet paid me my money. Feels like they are trying to hold on to it and not give it to me. Uber does not care about their drivers at all. Uber always feels the customer is right which is not the truth at all. Uber needs to get it together something serious.\n",
      "I was a Uber driver .1st Uber took money from the trips we get ,they took the surge from us ,(uber eats drivers)and the extra money they would let us earn ,they used to have it to where if you finished your bonus before the weekend ,Uber would give you another bonus for the weekend ,now they just have it to where you do 70 trips (185$)you do the remaining 50 ,you get the remainder of the money which would be (120$),and the other thing for me is everytime you get close to hitting your bonus (either 1)they will sit up there and have the nerve to put you on ice ,in other words not give you any pings  and also Uber will tell you how long it's going to take you to get to the restaurant or customers house and for some reason to me ,it's been a few times where I could have swore Uber was wrong on the distance .I used to love Uber but now that I see they don't give a $#*! about there drivers ,really $#*!ed up on Ubers part\n",
      "I have a serious problem. For about two and a half months now, Uber has put a restriction on my instant pay. They first claimed this was because a customer informed that I never delivered her food. This is not true. I do not even know who this customer is. So I filed an appeal through Uber. Then I called back to follow up on the appeal, but then was told that the reason there was a restriction is because I changed my account information too many times. I asked why would this be an issue. If this is a 1099 business type, I have the right to change it as many times as I want. I have a 4.8 star rating and have been employed with Uber for about 3 years now and never had a problem. I have always represented them in a dignified and respectable way. \n",
      "Just not good. Try to book a ride to the airport and the app say something about invalid payment method with American Express. So bad trying to resolve the issue and still not being resolve. Better get taxi cap.\n",
      "Wife and I recently started driving Uber after our teenager had surgery and we had 5 figures worth of out of pocket expenses. My wife started working with Uber 3 weeks before me and she referred me. Since then, I get non-stop promotions every single week for the last 3 months. Most recently I started getting \"objectives\" bonuses based on how many customers I take in a week to get an extra bonus.\n",
      "I drove a cab for over 10 years. I think you're doing the community a great service and understand the payment of what you're doing. People that NEVER drove a cab or service alike don't understand. Those are the people that needs to go back to work doing something else and leave this type of business. They're trying to ruin what decent service we have for the community. Those that want to strike are probably the ones that destroyed the cab business. Keep doing what you're doing. You can't make everybody happy. That's life!!\n",
      "Uber have drivers going to areas needing a lot of rides, offering promotion and not paying!!! When you call to inform them they make up rules other than the initial ones. I have been cheated twice!!! They don't provide a way to legitimately complain, putting people on the phone that you can barely understand. They do not care about their drivers!!!!\n",
      "After comparing Uber and Lyft prices for about a $40 ride, I choose Uber although the price was slightly higher just as a preference. Few mins after the ride was complete, I received an email with adjusted fair, which was $10 more than the upfront price. When contacted Uber, they gave all kind of excuses to not refund the upcharge by claiming a route change etc. Driver (a human) missed one turn and took the next one which probably change the total by 0.8 mile. Not my fault or indeed anyone's, as this is a common occurrence. \n",
      "Last night I took Uber to go from SNA to San Clemente. The fare estimate included taking a route that required tolls. However the actual ride did NOT take the toll road. This is the second time I was charged for a toll that was not used. In addition, there was a 3 cent wait charge. 3 cents is not the issue, there was no wait time involved. I waited for the car to arrive at the pick up location, traffic was non-existent all the way to SC. Does UBER arbitrarily charge things!!!! When the first ride had the toll charge, I sent an email to UBER because calling them and getting them to answer is next to impossible. Anyone else have a similar experience? JO\n",
      "Today evening around 8:50 pm, going from East coast Rd Intercontinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort in Chennai to EPA PACIFIC CITY APARTMENT which is 11KMs, I took Uber. Pathetic experience and worst thing I did. Driver was so damn rude and ill mannered and as the fare should have been maximum 150-200, somewhere between which is the unusual fare for this trip on. I paid RS 630+toll tax of 37 and driver telling me I owe RS 630 which was showing for my last trip from Intercontinental Resort to Airport which I didn't took! I couldn't understand WHY I was being falsely accused of having outstanding balance, nor WHY the fare should have been so much. Just 11kms. Quoted rupees more than the fare I already paid! \n",
      "I have drove for Uber more than a two years and their customer service never understand your problems. Uber never takes responsibility if a rider damage your car. Recently a rider ripped the plastics off the door and Uber representatives said is a normal used issue!! My car is eight month old and the other doors are perfect. I'm so upset. Drive for Lyft. Customer support is better!!!\n",
      "Uber charged me about a total of 30 dollars because their drivers could not find the Uber pick up lot  at the ft lauderdale airport.  one driver made it there and did not speak English.Two others went to departure lanes.  i complained and got back 6,00. several people have told me they have the same problems with Uber.\n",
      "I have worked as Uber driver for the past few months putting a minimum of 6 hours a day and I realized the money one makes after paying for gas, maintenance, depreciation, and wear and tear is nothing more than 7.50 per hour. To be a dishwasher at a restaurant one could make far more than this. To claim they are your partner, it is true because they take 50% of the fee and contribute 0% to the expenses.\n",
      "I have changed my phone number back in December 2018 but didn't try to change my phone number on my Uber app until recently. While I was able to change it on the app, I can't update the payment information. I reached out to customer service and they asked me bunch of questions like sending them screenshot of my phone number, name on the account, last ride taken, etc. \n",
      "I received half coke all spilled and fries were all sad and Mc Oreo flurry was open all melted.. I send feedback immediately on app.. Send pic of coke too.. And they only refunded for Oreo flurry.. Rest all food was wasted.. BUT NIRAJ ** said that madam apne Sirf Oreo k bare me Likha.. But he dint understand English review about entire order was waste.. And was arguing with me on call... Highly not recommended... Zomato and Swiggy is far better... At least Customer service is literate there.\n",
      "The last two times I have taken an Uber from my work to my home in the suburbs they have added $2.86 SURCHARGE. The surcharge says for tolls/parking/etc so I didn't figure it would apply to me. My work is in a suburb. I used Uber twice in two days, first time at 11:30am and second time at 930pm. NO SPORTS around, NO CONCERTS around, NOTHING around. They added $2.86 SURCHARGE. So when I wrote them they said prime time/weather/sporting events/etc could be the reason??!! WRONG! Nothing near me except 15 Uber cars spinning around waiting. This is fraud if they do not have to tell you WHAT the surcharge is for?? They can't tell me why I have paid it for both of my rides. They just keep saying due to \"high volume\". So I asked when is NOT HIGH VOLUME?? They said they do not know. FRAUD. Please investigate them. Thx!\n",
      "I suppose my 1st; emotional review was rejected by this site because it was anonymous. Too bad because people say all truths with 1st story. So because they decided to support Uber and not post my real-life experiences, hear it a filtered narrative. I work for Uber but before I worked for Uber I was a passenger. Uber - Passenger: Uber is pre-installed on ALL androids because some politician was paid and lobbyist got this approved. This is probably why this company gets away with so much **. Uber is a technology and is run from Philippines or India with some fake headquarters in California. I called the California attorney general to issue complaints ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã¢Â€Âœ THAT HOW I FOUND OUT.\n",
      "I'm A Uber Driver & In Not Happy With Uber Right Now... They Keep Playing With My MONEY HONEY... Instant Pay Is A JOKE... I Have The Same Bank Info Since I Started With Uber.. Now All Of A Sudden The SYSTEM FLAGING MY CARD... And EveryTime I Talk To A Representative They SAY THE SAME SH**...They Just Reading A Da** Computer Skit... And U Cant Talk To AnyBody @ Corporate They Have A Da** Recording.... You GUY'S OR FULL OF MALARKEY.... Drop The Mic....\n",
      "Uber's customer service is beyond horrible. It's been three weeks and I still can't get them to reset my account. Someone answers after three emails maybe. Then they ask the same questions. And then never respond again. If you have an issue, don't expect it to ever be solved. This isn't my first encounter. My previous company stopped working with them as a business client because they never responded to any of our emails.\n",
      "I booked a ride for 7:30 AM and the driver shows up at 7:05 and calls me to come down. I politely said I would be there in about 10 minutes and that I had booked my ride for 7:30. The driver hang up and didn't say anything until the end of the trip when I arrived at the airport, only to find that I was charged a considerable (almost 15% of the whole bill) fee for \"waiting time.\" How is this ok when the trip actually started earlier than scheduled, which was entirely at the driver's will? Now that I did some research, it seems that in 2017 Uber added tons of hidden fees that are controlled 100% by drivers so they had many more ways to get paid more, of course by the consumer who knows nothing all so that Uber didn't have to spend a cent more on their contractor drivers. Utterly a scam. \n",
      "I have been a customer for several years, recently purchased a new phone and no longer remembered my password and switched jobs so didn't have access/the email connected to the account no longer existed. Despite proving my identity over 10+ emails and several days and providing a new contact email, Uber has yet to reset my account. In fact, the first several emails simply copied and pasted the website's recommendation. I have deleted their app and plan on using Lyft in the future. What kind of company can't help a customer use its platform? Ridiculous.\n",
      "Customer supports are the most incompetent people I've ever interacted with in my life. After the 8th interaction, I get a new person every time. They clearly don't spend any time reading past interactions, mention surface issues, and close the case. It's ridiculous. Account payment not working for 1 month. Changed cards, reinstalled, deleted cache => nothing works.\n",
      "I've never had a problem with Uber until last night. I scheduled a ride last night and it cost $12.00. When I called for a pickup they told me it would be a while and that the price went from $12.00 to $40.00 because they were busy, what B.S. So I wheeled my friend and her wheelchair at night in the dark at 12 midnight through a bad area because no one was available to pick me up and I only had enough money for the original price of $12.00. Being a female with a disabled person in a wheelchair was a very dangerous situation. I really think Uber stinks because of this.\n",
      "Ordered a meal that never arrived. Uber Eats took the money from my account. After contacting Uber Eats they said they would refund the money to my account. The money was never refunded. Do not trust this company!!!!\n",
      "Uber is \"generally\" quick, reliable, and safe. Only had 1 driver with strong smell of marijuana in the car- put me on guard of being pulled over by police. Otherwise, drivers I've encounter were courteous and cognizant of their safety as well as mine by introducing themselves and calling me by name. I always check the license plate before entering the automobile.\n",
      "Firstly Uber uses an outsourced call center to receive and take calls for their company. The employee I spoke to was a supervisor by the name of JOHN who was in the Philippines. He did not care about my concerns about my safety. They are unconsidered with their employee's SAFETY. The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that's did not feel or look safe. Ubers only consider is making sure you get the rider to their destination and not how to protect its drivers from harm while driving. This company should really evaluate the safety for not only their riders but their Drivers as well. \n",
      "Apparently Uber EATS in Canada doesn't give a crap about their customers. My order was so simple, yet they managed to screw it up anyways YET AGAIN. I ordered some fries, a couple of burgers and a green tea at around 1 or 2 a.m. and everything went pretty smoothly. The driver was a very nice guy and the delivery was quite speedy. I enjoyed most of my meal until I got to this disgusting, disrespectful, sorry excuse for a Junior Chicken. Apparently someone from the McDonald's at St Clair/Victoria Park (Toronto, Ontario) thought it would be hilarious to douse my Junior Chicken with a bunch of Chili Pepper Flakes and some strange tasting sauce.\n",
      "After a long trip we took Uber from our airport to home. It was my fault that in gathering our things I left one small bag in the back seat. I have been trying to contact the driver/Uber since then. My first attempt to contact the driver was successful in reaching him BUT he promised to bring the bag over but hasn't shown up yet (48 hours). I have tried contacting him again through the Uber App, which is the only way I know to get in touch with him. No return calls yet. I then went back to the app and followed the \"can't contact the driver\" link and have reached out to Uber to become involved -- twice. No response from Uber. This is NOT what I think of when I think of customer service. The bag contains critical things like me heart/BP Medication and my passport!\n",
      "I ordered an Uber. Price estimate was between 27-35$. I ordered Uber, and they charged me 73.00$. More than double the price estimate. There was no traffic. I took that route multiple times, at different times of the day and the maximum charge for the trip was 38-40$. Now 73.00$. I wrote to them numerous times, but they gave me silly explanation and never refunded my money. Definitely they should not charge me more than 35$. They have your credit cards, and they think they can charge whatever they feel like it. Someone has to look at what Uber is doing.\n",
      "I have been a driver with Uber for the last two-and-a-half years. I have been through thick and thin with him and their customers doing bad things to me as a driver. I stop driving for them for a while and hope that things would change. They have upgraded the app so I tried to start driving again. They wanted a new picture of my license. I've uploaded it over 10 times, sent to them multiple pictures and they keep on saying poor image and then they won't approve it. And when I call him they have excuses on all its poor image. Part of it's always the same thing. They will never let you talk to a supervisor. Never let you talk to a manager. They never let you talk to anybody in charge. There's always people laughing in the background. They don't have no respect for their drivers and whoever is going to drive for them. They just need to stop because Uber won't back you up.\n",
      "As a new sign up, I was advised that once I complete 60 rides I will be given an additional $350 dollars as a bonus. This was not the case. Apparently the agent explaining the details missed to clarify that $350 dollars are guaranteed for the first 60 rides. In other words, if the total for the rides do not add up to $350 dollars, they will pay the difference.\n",
      "When Uber runs over its customers.  Buyer betware - Ueber is not all that is seems.  At first I liked it. Ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people.  But it's a crap shoot.  I'd estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them Uber has no customer support.  There's no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company.  Case in point:  Take Bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination.  Bill drives a Grand Cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime.  When Bill dropped me off at Planet Fitness I immediately noticed I left my bag containing an IPod and Bose headphones in the back seat. About $600 worth of equipment.  I tried to wave him down but he wouldn't stop.  Since then I have sent over 30 texts to him, the local Ueber office, and the corporate hub in Stamford.  I even asked the Stamford police to investigate.  As of this moment neither Bill nor Uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service.  The car will get you from point A to poing B but after that your on your own.  Uber won't lift a finger to help.  Do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet, or keys, or handbag, or smartphone, or lose engagement ring on your finger? The smart answer is no. Bill is still out there. Lyft is the same as Uber.  I'll check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than Uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance, even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars.\n",
      "I'm going on day two of being an Uber driver and I hate it. Uber pays you less to do long distance drives and they don't follow through with their promises. Before I get into that my biggest complaint is the navigation system. It's inaccurate and very slow. They try to blame your phone service but if it were my service then my maps on my phone or the Waze app (which is what I use on the daily) would glitch out as well.\n",
      "I downloaded UberEats for the first time today and received an error message while trying to place an order. The help website was totally useless and I place 3 calls to the support line. During the 1st call I was told that I needed to delete my credit card and reenter it to fix the problem. That did not work and the support representative in the 2nd call told me I was in good standing but should try an alternate card. This did not work either in the representative. In the 3rd call told me to email support to get a higher level support person. Uber responded to my email by telling me that my account was suspended due to \"suspect appeasement\". I have no idea what that means, but needless to say I have decided to use a service that actually wants customers e.g. DoorDash.\n",
      "I been using Uber for a while. I had to go grocery shopping and the trip from my home to the grocery store. Stopped on the way to mail my rent out. Put it in the outside box. The trip was like 1 1/2 miles. I was charged 9.99. BUT my ride home from the grocery store, they charged me $33.00 and change. What a ripoff! Same distance when I was going there. I wrote them and complained and they wrote me telling me they weren't giving me any kind of refund. That is so unfair. Yes, big ripoff!!!\n",
      "I was in Madrid with my wife and it was around 8 pm in front of El Corte Ingles, big store like Macy's, so we decide to call Uber for get a ride to the hotel. We wait over 45 minutes, Uber never arrive. But the surprise was that Uber charge to my credit card $ 7.00 Euros ($9.00 US money twice total $18.00 US). On top of that they said that I took the ride to my hotel and the place another charge for $69.00 US. I dispute to the Bank of America for over two months, finally the bank say I have not prove of been or not taking the ride, therefore, \"Sorry we can't give you the refund.\" So the Bank of America protect Uber, not the customer and to me Uber in Spain is totally a scam. Taxis in Madrid are excellent, inexpensive courteous driver and the best is that they're all over the city of Madrid.\n",
      "I started driving Uber September of 2016, during that time business was good was getting lots of rides. I completed over 5000 rides in 2 years while maintaining a 8.6 rating. But lately Uber has really has gone down hill. Less riders because everyone drives now, pay has gone down considerably since they take 25%. But what really broke the straw was yesterday I drive in Chicago and have to do Uber pool rides, a rider complained about there was 4 people in my car! So she was first rider then 2 people jumped in and pick up 1 more person. I apologized for the inconvenience, I was very kind and social, the ride gave me 1 star because of something I have no control over how many riders in my car.\n",
      "I have used Uber for a while now frequently during the week. Recently, upon returning from a two week holiday, I get back to business as usual and my usual route has a price hike from $12.50/$13 to a whopping $27.98 for an UberX. Also, two days in a row I've been charged more than the price shown for the same route I've been taking for months! Uber May be fine for â€œNew Usersâ€œ and folks that aren't frequent riders. Otherwise, prepare to be ripped off. I'm done with them. They lost my business.\n",
      "Uber is the worst service provider ever. I booked a cab from Yeshwantput to Marathalli which cost 320-350 RS. The driver stopped the cab after few min in a highway and said he cannot go any further as the mode of payment was online and he doesn't have the money to put petrol. The trip cost me 80 RS and after then when I booked another cab I had to pay 550 so in total I had to pay more than 600 rs. I want to know who will pay the extra charge that I had to bear.\n",
      "Unable to sign in to app. Able to sign in to website, but cannot update any information. Cannot add credit card or payment option. Cannot find a way to use their advance ride scheduling. Contacted support, which was absolutely useless. They did not address my issues at all. NUTS!!!\n",
      "I have had some very positive experiences with Uber, but two experiences were terrible. The first bad experience I had was a driver criticized me for not being able to drive myself. The second happened this morning (1/6/19). I had ordered an Uber at 7:02 a.m. and saw that the driver was only six minutes away which would've been more than enough time to get me to work at 7:30. I kept an eye on my Uber app to see how close the driver was and noticed at 7:10 they were about a block away. I waited in front of my house for 22 minutes and when I saw they hadn't moved since 7:10 I was forced to cancel my ride and call a taxi. Not only was I 15 minutes late to my job, but I was also charged a cancelation fee.\n",
      "Charged a no-show fee for a malfunction in driver's Uber app.   (3rd person button in shared ride wouldn't light up so the ride wouldn't start.)  Driver tried to fix the glitch for 10 long minutes.  Then he said nicely, we would have to all get out and start our ride search over again.  (in frigid weather at Laguardia airport.)  We were all charged a no-show fee.  My co-rider found no way to contact any customer support at UBER.\n",
      "I have had it where an Uber driver has canceled a trip and then the payment is reversed but the next payment is a higher fee which they do not show until after the trip has ended. I have also had it where they have charged me twice for the same trip or added a penalty that should not have been there.\n",
      "My rating keeps going down every time I ride. I am a pleasant customer. Either uber app is messed up or something else. Why no promotion's or discounts? I have been using it for past 2 years and no discounts. HuH! avoid.\n",
      "Girlfriend ask me to send her an Uber, so l ordered the economic or pool which US$3.30. l provided the exact address of my girlfriend which was going to ride to my apt. Well after a while UBER sent me a text that the ride was canceled by driver, and also to try one more time with another driver. Well l tried, so finally succeed, but the driver could not find the address l provided. He went to another address, but finally reached the destination provided. l called the driver and he told me that he was sent to another address, but the address l provided was accurate. But as l said before, finally reached my girlfriend and brought her to her destination. \n",
      "I just had my second experience with Uber doubling my fare. The quoted fare was MX $73 pesos and I was charged MX $148.99. A taxi to my destination, which I go regularly, is MX $80. I would never get in a cab without confirming the fare, or buy an airline ticket. Why would Uber expect me to do that? For the fare to be over DOUBLE the quote is criminal. Why would I continue to use Uber if their rates are double that of a taxi?\n",
      "I have used Uber to get to and from places and generally have never had any issues. During certain nights, events or holidays they, as well as other companies, are known to increase the price of transport. For example, the general price to and from my house to downtown is $18 but they increased the price to $30 on New Year's of 2017-2018. That was annoying because they knew that many people would be vulnerable at 2-3 am and willing to pay that amount to get home. It was frustrating but doable, especially if you were lucky enough to find a buddy to split it with. However, this New Year's (2018-2019) Uber began adding surge charges in the beginning of events, thus I was charged about $30 to get to the event and then they had the audacity to increase the surge charge to $98 for the return trip! $98! Almost $100 to be driven 15 to 20 min. away. That is beyond ridiculous. \n",
      "Uber charged me twice for the same ride and then told me one of my friends or my family must have used my charge account to book the second ride to the same place on the same day and they even added a tip for the driver of the ride I did not take.Uber's advertisement that you can now CALL Uber for customer service is a bald faced lie, there is no phone number and no customer service by phone whatsoever.Uber's business model is based on lies, dishonesty, and illegal behavior as anyone who follows current news can see.\n",
      "I also went back to driving UBER after losing my job, all my information was updated and on 12/26 I received a $2.00 direct deposit. What I earn was 108.31. I'm still waiting. I haven't drove. Battery is dead in my car and I have not been able to pay my phone bill. The third party customer service those people have no clue. They're rude and honestly they're stealing our money. I am really disappointed in Uber. My situation has gotten worse. Waiting for my money.\n",
      "I recently started driving with Uber again and it's only been a month. But somehow 4 times that I tried to do instant pay it fails. SMH. And when I calls driver support they tries to blame everyone but their selves. And this last time it failed. I've been waiting a week and still haven't been paid. If you're thinking about driving for Uber, I wouldn't. They don't care about the inconvenience of not paying you after you worked hard for them and they are very unprofessional.\n",
      "Uber is a great business idea, in theory. Employ ambitious people willing to provide a cheap taxi service using their own vehicles for those brave souls willing to get into a stranger's messy car with the expectation of getting to their destination alive and in one piece for an agreeable price. Less costly than a limo, and far better than collecting returnable cans and bottles from the roadside for those seeking easy cash income. Win-win, right? Not so fast. Without delving into the obvious, the possibility of slipping into the back seat of a serial killer or the rolling annex of a hoarder's hovel, allow me to address the drivers here, who have only recently been permitted to receive and expect a TIP from their passengers, in addition to their 70% share of the cost of an Uber ride from their (yes, brave) fares.\n",
      "If anything goes wrong with the instant payment option, you have to have your bank account linked or you can't get paid. So if you don't have enough a bank account you're screwed and will not be paid. Their support told me this. I'm writing a review and reporting them.\n",
      "On Tuesday December 24, 2018 at about 5:37 am I opened the Uber app on my tablet and immediately confirmed a pick for $13.92 (pool). The car came by at about 5:39/5:40 am. Slowed down as I was approaching, sped off about a block, slowed down again and did a u-turn to the opposite side of the street. All this time I began running after it. I caught it at the stop light, opened the door and got in. He claimed he did not see me coming after him. This was strange, the street was empty, early morning and with my hands waving I was unseen? God bless there was the stop light that have him came to a complete stop.\n",
      "So apart from some miscommunications with my captains a couple of times, it has always been a fair bit of help. Wonder if they can work up their discount game a little more. Great vehicles most of the times though. All in all, a \"yes\" for me.\n",
      "Tried to register on the website to get a trip to the airport. The website needs to be revamped so it's user friendly and does not take your valuable time away. I used the Super Shuttle instead after dealing with the bad website. Not sure why it can't be a little easier to book a trip with a car. This is ridiculous.\n",
      "My daughter used Uber services to take a ride to her destination in Philadelphia. After exiting the car and crossing the street, the Uber driver hit her with the car knocking her to the ground. Once she got up, the Uber driver returned to her car and drove away, leaving my daughter standing at the curb. Unacceptable. Highly recommend not using over services. Only reason I am giving this one star is because it will not let me proceed with this comment without giving it at least 1 star.\n",
      "I scheduled a driver for three hours away, for when I needed to go to the airport. One showed up immediately, and then charged me a 'cancellation fee' for not being packed. Uber said they would cancel it. But they only gave me a credit toward a future ride. They refused to refund it, as any ethical company would do. So they made a big profit of $6 on the deal. Because I do not deal with unethical companies. Lyft is just fine.\n",
      "I've spent hours trying to register on the app. The support team hasn't been helpful. At this point I want compensation for the time invested in it. But of course these cheapskates won't pay out unless forced to.\n",
      "I've wasted several hours of my time trying to register for this app. It's a scam. The support desk is completely incompetent, too.\n",
      "I set up an Uber account in June 2018 for a trip scheduled to Seattle. I used the train system instead of Uber, however, someone had used my account several times in foreign countries and edited my personal account. I've tried several times to reach someone to cancel/refund my account but keep get redirected to use the â€œhelpâ€ link within my account. I'm unable to communicate through the help link because the person whose edited my account has access to it! It's crazy. I've sent a message through â€œGet Human Servicesâ€ for Uber to contact me immediately and provided my cell last week - still no follow-up. Uber has no customer services value and clearly shows it. I'm appalled at their lack of services that get so much national exposure/marketing. All I want is to have safety of my personal information and stop others from using it. Be aware of your potential risks before signing up.\n",
      "I paid cash on 11/21 Thanksgiving eve because I was travelling overseas and did not want to use any money from my account as I had bills planned ahead while I was away, so I took an Uber to JFK that day and it went well then about two weeks later on 12/8 I returned and again took an Uber from JFK to my home and still paid cash. Only to look in my bank account two days later and found Uber had charged me twice both journeys. They refunded me some of it and they are still holding my money. I went back and forth with them via FB messenger because of course you can never call them since they don't reveal their phone numbers to customers. I am still waiting for them to honor their word and save their reputation. I will continue to complain until they return my full amount.\n",
      "This complaint is as much for Uber as it is its insurance company, the James River Insurance Company. I was hit by an Uber driver on August 25th, 2018 in Connecticut while riding on my motorcycle. Although I suffered many injuries, I am alive and am grateful for that. What I am not grateful for is Uber's insurance company that still has not settled on a fair price for my totaled motorcycle. I had a lot taken from me that night and have had zero compassion from the insurance company that represents Uber drivers. I have made numerous phone calls and emails to James River Insurance Company without return calls or emails. It's now going on five months with no agreement on a settlement, and that is appalling. I will be publishing more news about Uber and James River Insurance company on this site and others in the upcoming days. My goal will be to spread awareness about unfair practices that are being used by both companies.\n",
      "I took a ride on Sunday evening and didn't touch alcohol that night, absolutely no incident happened inside the car that night. Today I am being charged 150$ for a cleaning service!!! Drivers are scamming customers, making up stories so they can get extra cash. Uber should be ashamed of the service that they have been providing. It's very unethical and embarrassing for the company to keep people like that.\n",
      "Uber has no method for allowing users to establish accounts with phone numbers that do not receive SMS messages. As a result, none of the apps I downloaded will work, and I cannot request rides. Their helpdesk has not responded to me with any useful information.\n",
      "They charged me a $125 transaction fee for a trip that costs $5.00. How is that even possible? This is a scam! I took a ride less than a mile and this is what I was charged. It's unbelievable. I was way overcharged. It's fraud!\n",
      "Suddenly Uber is adding an extra $2.50 to your ride. They call it a surcharge and when you complain try to explain that perhaps the driver paid a toll, even if the driver arrived within 2 minutes (literally) of your call. They are doing nothing more than taking more money and offering nothing in exchange. They want as much of your money as they can get their hands on. Beware. They'll call it any name they can think of. Tolls? Not. Surcharge? Definitely. More money in the Uber coffers. Rider beware!\n",
      "I requested a driver to take me about 25 miles. The stated fare was $42.07...reasonable for the long distance, and I have a pass which discounts the trip afterwards. I watched on the app as the assigned car drove around about 3 miles away...then received a request to rate my trip, all within about 5 min of requesting the 25 mile trip. I figured the driver must have cancelled or something and requested a new trip. The second driver came and drove me to the requested destination. Same distance, same stated fare, no problem. I noticed later that I had been charged for both trips though. I know mistakes happen, so just messaged Uber to request that they refund the trip that did not occur. \n",
      "When I scheduled Uber to pick me up at 6AM and take me to the airport, the instructions I received stated that the driver would arrive between 6 and 6:10, and I would be charged every minute I was late. The driver arrived at 6am, I walk out at 6:05 only to find that the driver left!!! Luckily, I had a car and there was enough time to drive to the airport and park my car. Otherwise, I would've have missed my flight!\n",
      "I have been riding Uber premier cars for the past 2-years in various Indian cities. What I have seen is that the 100% of Indian Uber drivers as all the other taxi drivers in the country do not close their windows and use air-conditioning or heater (in winter) when they are not on a trip with their riders. The Uber drivers thus maintain a filthy interior with dusts of all kinds on all the cars along with mosquitoes freely 'roaming' inside the cars. \n",
      "I scheduled my ride 3 days ago for Friday night to go to an event that cost me $450.  The ride never showed so I scheduled another ride.  Confirmed it and another no show.  I ended up driving myself and being late.  Inexcusable.\n",
      "I've been waiting a week for a check from them. I have auto payment for my bills and got charged $70 from the bank because I didn't have the money in there for them. I called and was told it was a â€œglitchâ€. It shouldn't take more than a week to fix. Asked to talk to a supervisor and got completely blown off. Terrible company to work with.\n",
      "Uber uses every trick they can to get you out of every penny. It's sicking. The customer service suck, or lack thereof. The company doesn't even have a number for the riders to call. I was charged for two different rides that I never took, this was three days ago and I still have not heard from Uber. This company needs to be checked. Our country has checks and balances just for scam companies just like this!\n",
      "My ride canceled itself within like 2 seconds of booking it three times in a row and got charged every time. This happened before and I let it slide but it happened three times in a row again. Money is being stolen here and help is useless. Very hard to navigate the help page and no contact email or phone. Thieves! Going on to their competition now... Should of done it long time ago!\n",
      "Recently bought an Uber with a few friends in Grand Rapids, MI. Once we got in his car he refused to drive us anywhere unless we gave him extra cash. My friend refused to let us give cash because she recently had been in another Uber in New York City who demanded extra cash and then kicked her out of his car. Never riding Uber again.\n",
      "If your son/daughter uses Uber - beware. My son recently used Uber and was charged a $150 cleaning fee. The driver submitted pictures taken from someone else's ride, and claimed the mess was made by him and his girlfriend. He contacted Uber to refute these charges, and told them to check the date and time on the picture. Uber said they didn't have that information. Apparently they believe whatever their drivers tell them. He went back and forth with Uber. Finally, I sent an email and told them the driver would have that info, and we would seek legal counsel if necessary. They soon refunded his money. On a Google search, I found out many Uber drivers do this. They often set up their car to show a mess, use the same pictures over and over again, and even have a bank of \"messy car\" pictures they submit. My advice - take pictures of the inside of the car before you leave.\n",
      "It always shows as 5 min for arrival before booking the cab. As soon you I book the cab it takes 15-20 mins for the arrival. It still shows 12 mins arrival. You will not get to cancel the ride even because they charge cancellation fee for that. Always it has been a Worst experience.\n",
      "No show. Never again. Airport. Uber booked for 0815. 0810 driver cancelled. 0815 booked another. 0840 driver phoned - can't find the address. 0850 driver cancelled. 0855. Panicking. Tried again. 0915 Uber arrived, not mine. Driver said would cancel client and take me for 30 euros.\n",
      "Buyer beware! Do not buy an Uber gift card. I received one as a gift, and tried to use it to take a trip with Uber. The card did not work. I have sent 25 requests to Uber customer service, and have been told 25 times that Uber cannot apply gift cards to rides and they do not issue refunds. Please do not buy an Uber gift card! Uber customer service does not help with gift card issues. The only way to contact Uber customer service is through the app. They do not have a phone number.\n",
      "I needed to grab a ride in pouring rain for 3-4 blocks. I'd been given a code for discount ride that was never credited. Then found another charge of $40 on my card. When I made a complaint their answer was I had made a mess requiring cleaning. First off there is no way I'd made a mess with 1 small bag and just sitting there. And if I got seat wet, well it's pouring rain! I could of gotten entire car cleaned for that much. I'm handicapped and on a fixed income. This extra fee causes a hardship and actually takes food from my table. I've used this company for years and have had good and bad but this is robbing me and taking advantage of a trust with my bank info. Company cannot be trusted.\n",
      "I schedule two Ubers for a trip to the airport for a group of 6. The first Uber arrived and took half of the group. The second Uber was late. As per their policy, I was credited $10 for being late. I could see the Uber coming up the street, then turn around and cancel us. He said he had car trouble. My guess is he had just been notified he lost $10 for running late and decided not to complete the ride. There were no other rides available for more than an hour. We had to drive ourselves and pay for parking for the entire trip, plus pay for the additional Uber which we would not have needed if I knew we were driving ourselves. Uber just sent a canned response/apology. Unacceptable service!\n",
      "I was in the middle of my ride, maybe not even the middle 1/4 of the way to my destination and realized I can should switch my destination to another closer location. To edit your location, you have to click the search icon and edit your destination. Cool, However it wouldn't let me. Inside the part where the search icon is and on top of that was a location symbol. Basically means you can't change it. The location you picked is where you're going. I figured this can't be right and starting trying to get answers in why, I cannot change it. I was so furious!!! But because I selected a CHEAPER ride like Uber pool which makes total sense because it's CHEAPER!!! But Uber won't allow you to change it, if you selected Uber pool. Ok, I don't get it.\n",
      "Their price is too high compared to Lyft so I stopped using Uber. I had scheduled times to be picked up early for work and still was late because the app kept switching drivers and I scheduled the ride for the next morning so I had to actually get a Uber a hour before I have to get to work to be there on time.\n",
      "Headed to the airport, Uber asks me to confirm my phone number. I do, and they ask me to enter a 4 digit code that I never receive. I contact customer support via the app (there is no phone number), and they ask for my phone number, a screenshot of my phone number, and my last few trips. They contact me almost 2 hours after submitting these details to ask for these 3 details again. I sent this info again, and they reply with a similar message. I type everything out and take new screenshots of everything, and they once again ask me for my phone number. I finally ask, \"Is there any way I can continue using your app, or do I have to use a competitor going forward?\" 20 hours passes. No answer. All I want to do is use the app, all of my info is the same, and has never changed.\n",
      "â€œHi, I would like a credit for the inconvenience my colleagues and students had to go through, as well as myself. I scheduled and placed this order at 8:30pm, for delivery between 10pm-10:30pm. At 11:00pm it was still pending, so we got food for our kids from somewhere else. At 12:20am, I just received a message that the order was accepted and is being delivered. This is unacceptable, as we had to spend $120 on room service due to the fact we could not reach the restaurant or Uber Eats and our students had to eat.\n",
      "...but it is not Lyft.  Lyft pays better and quicker.  I am trying to change up my driving profile and they hassle you with constant emails.\n",
      "After an hour of waiting for our food, Uber tracking online said it was delivered but no food. Contacted the restaurant, they said not their problem but did give us the driver mobile number, We rang the driver, and she said that she couldn't find the address so she binned it. Submitted a complaint via Uber forms and no response. We will no longer use Uber Eats... It's a pity because the Uber taxi is a good service but I may need to cancel my account in protest.\n",
      "I haven't used Uber in a couple of years. I was recently asked by my employer to activate Uber for business and link my personal account. The last time I attempted to log in to the Uber app, it wouldn't accept my password. I attempted to reset it, but never received the verification texts they sent me so I could not. I have since gotten new phone number and so I had no way to receive their verification texts. I contacted customer service and they responded with a generic reply asking for the same information I sent them in the help form. I replied giving them this information again and explaining that I could not get the verification texts so I could not reset my password. They asked me to provide a screenshot of the phone number on my phone, which I did, and then they replied saying it didn't match their records. Of course it didn't match their records! I already told them that. \n",
      "My elderly mother took ill and was hospitalized. I immediately booked a bus to head to the state she resides as I have moved away. The driver came to my neighborhood. I called to guide him to my home and he cancelled causing me to not be able to make my bus on time and unable to get a refund on my ticket. I am out of $70 bus fare with Uber basically offering no help or a solution. I was unable to spend for another ticket which leaves my mother to go home without care upon her discharge. The driver should be made to pay for my financial loss as people depend on their services. I was given no assistance and told they were unable to do anything about my financial loss.\n",
      "I am a regular user of Uber cabs from the moment it was introduced in Hyderabad. I never had major issues with the services and I am happy to be using their hassle free services except for the Uber ride services. I have been using Uber ride pass since September 4 2018 and for the month of November this would be 3rd time of opting the Uber ride pass services for the year 2018. Since September 2018 the Uber ride pass flat fare is made applied along with overage on 90% of my rides during September and October 2018 rides. During one such ride, the fare was calculated wrongly and extra amount was charged instead of the actual amount which was shown before confirming the ride. \n",
      "Sketchy minivan came to pick up my mom and me up in a dark, isolated place where they never would have known there were people waiting for an Uber. A large good looking ** man (about 35-40ish) that had the likeness of an '80s rapper got out of the front seat, sat in the back and motioned for us to get in. The driver, a Pacific Island or Asian descent man (about 40-45ish, or more) who had the likeness of the guy from Fantasy Island looked nothing like the photo of the driver in the app and didn't respond to the mentioned name. Wrong car. Set up like a ride share in the Maryland Baltimore area. Driver not the driver in the photo in the app. Driver did not respond to his name or know my name. What the heck, Uber?!\n",
      "Disgustingly poor customer service. Responses in the app seem to come from robots because I received the same response 5 TIMES to my initial inquiry and follow up responses. It seems like there are no humans that actually write back to you. I tried to get help from their support account Twitter handle but of course it was disgustingly unhelpful as well where I was told to just keep going back and forth with these robots responding in the app. I guess I'm never going to get my issues resolved which means I'm losing money. Despicable way to treat customers.\n",
      "I would like for everyone to be safe for the holidays and also I wanted to share my HORRIBLE experience with Uber Atlanta Uber/Lyft Drivers United. So I was headed home from work and I rake a Uber from the train station and the Uber driver got ready turn in the neighborhood. And I told him this is the wrong neighborhood and Uber driver tells me, \"I'm following the GPS\" and proceed to go in the neighborhood and pulls up to a house that was also not mine. I then told him once again this is not where I live. And moral of the story I end up having to walk home and I will no longer be riding with UBER. They are unsafe and drivers don't care about your safe. I have continua to report my issue and they did nothing about us and thought a 5 dollar credit would solve the problem. I am terrified and very scared to after my multiple horrible experiences.\n",
      "Had a Uber car pick my wife and self from 701 S Olive Ave Florida from ride to airport which is 10 minutes away. The fare posted was $7.55. The driver put in a false claim for spilled coffee in back seat. Absolutely false and attempt to claim damages from us. Car was clean when we entered and left. Wasting time having to communicate with Uber.\n",
      "Uber keeps calling and sending ads to me to consider being a driver for them. I am a 66 year old lawyer and still very much active as a full time attorney. To my knowledge I only used them once, 5-6 years ago, to take my wife to a restaurant in NYC. It was not memorable for any reason. I would not dare step into one now after the rash of ** allegedly committed by their drivers. Same for LYFT.\n",
      "I have been using Uber for YEARS and use it often, I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on Uber, I am DONE. Uber does not screen their drivers anymore, drivers are rude or don't speak English which is the primary language where I live which makes it hard to communicate if need be, they do not check into the quality of the cars and I know this because I had a friend who has never used Uber sign up to be a driver and was approved after I had been picked up by more than 1 car with no ac and/or had some type of mechanical problem. \n",
      "I've been through so much with this app and it's only negative. I've had so much patience trying to deal with this company but nothing gets resolved except Uber taking my money. I bought $75 in Uber gift cards to get a $72 ride. They didn't allow me to use the gift cards and asked me to add a card. I followed instructions to do so. I had an active card but it kept asking me to update my billing settings. I KNOW everything was correct. For HOURS I WAITED IN THE COLD trying to figure out how to get one ride.\n",
      "I've been an Uber driver for over two years and despite my one star rating there are a lot of things I love about driving for Uber, and none of them have to do with the actual company. The things I like for instance meeting new people and seeing new sites have to do with industry itself and the fact that most people are generally nice. \n",
      "When I had to go to work, it showed that the ride would be $8.24. So I agreed, when I finally got in the Uber after waiting for over 20 mins, I seen on my screen that I am being charged 20.41! So I am livid because I did not have 20.41 to have someone drive me 15 mins! The drive took back streets and did not follow the route. I tried calling and emailing Uber with no response. I would like a credit for the amount that was originally appeared on my acct.\n",
      "This is the worst company and untrustworthy. I used them couple of times and until American Express offer 15 dollars for Uber ride monthly and Uber did not credit me for the first ride and I take 3 rides in one day but none of them was credit the 15.00 dollars until I order food and still didn't credit until I cancel my orders within minute that I order through Marco pizza in Norcross. And when I cancel the order which is total of 33 dollars and some change that's when Uber credited me after I cancel the order and I am still being charged for the food that I never had from Uber eats that they claim Marco pizza is already made my food and how's that possible after 1 min of ordering and have to cancel right away. \n",
      "I booked a pickup on my train to Alpharetta Georgia and when I arrived, the trip had been cancelled and I was charged a $6.00 cancellation fee. I had a gift certificate but it was very confusing how to use it and my trip (including the unexplainable $6.00 cancellation fee) was charged to my PayPal account. There is no one to contact to straighten this out. NEVER AGAIN!!!\n",
      "17 days after my ride I was charged $150.00. I got sick in the car because of the long ride and the way he drove. I made sure nothing got on the car! Why did I get charged so much for cleanup??? I understand a 40-50 charge but this is totally absurd. Now my total is $180.00??? Do not use as they can charge your credit card later whatever they want to charge and whenever there is no standard. Or deactivate your account after the ride. I saved no money using Uber. It's very difficult to contact support.\n",
      "This was the first time that I was using the Uber app. I attempted to set up a pick up for a future date to go to the airport. 5 over drivers showed up. One of them charge me a cancellation fee. One of them charge me for the trip to the airport that I never took. Once I realize that they were showing up I immediately texted the drivers and told them this was a mistake. I wanted it for a future date. They said no problem. However they still showed up and they still charge me. Do not use Uber. They are Crooks. The only reason I gave him one Stars they won't post this review unless you give them some type of rating so I gave them one star even though they deserve nothing.\n",
      "Why ask me to select photos of cars to prove that I am not a bot if I can only ever be talking to one on Uber's end? I switched carriers and got a new phone with a new number, which rendered me unable to sign into Uber, because I had no access to the previous phone number for verification codes. I learned there is only one way to reach out to Uber in such situation, through one email link on their website. I was not able to call them as they have made themselves unavailable to that for riders and I could not initiate a chat session with their support because I could not sign in at all, whether the app or the website.\n",
      "We use one credit card for Uber. We do not use this credit card for any other transactions. Our credit card was hacked last night. Thanks Uber for your outstanding anti-credit card theft program! Not!!!\n",
      "Uber charged me an additional $42 for a ride to Laguardia Airport. They would not correct my fare because they say I changed my Destination from Delta Arrivals to Laguardia airport. Idiotic and the fare shows my added charges as return tolls over the GW bridge!\n",
      "I've read many of the positive reviews and while I have had great drivers with Uber I've also had very bad drivers. It they are bad drivers and you think you can do something to get them removed from Uber think again. That's not going to happen. Probably the worst situation is lack of language skills with Uber drivers around NYC. Here is a case in point. I'm standing in pouring rain. Call an Uber says it will be 5 minutes. 10 minutes later I get a call from the Uber driver in serious broken English which took me about 3 times of asking \"What are you saying?\" \n",
      "Earlier for pool pickups stop were either 2 mins walking or if driver happen to cross my location then it gives option to not to walk. BUT NOW the pickups and drop offs are on different street, it's so far, it says 10 to 12 mins walking, I am seriously what's the point of taking cabs if we have to walk like taking any bus. Moreover Uber has increased its charges and also not giving any promotion offers, earlier I used to get 50% off but no - either no promotion or 30% off which actually brings back to earlier price thereby not helping in any way.\n",
      "This evening I placed an order with Swiss Chalet. Within seconds of submitting my order I realize my business address was selected instead of my home address. I hit the cancel button and my order was canceled instantly. This all happened within less than 10 seconds of confirming my order. I went back into Uber Eats and tried to select a Swiss Chalet with my home address but the restaurant did not come up. Assuming my order was canceled I went on SkipTheDishes and was able to place an order from a different location that was closer to my house. I then looked at my Uber Eats app and realized that they are not refunding my money for my order as they said the restaurant had already begun making the food. \n",
      "My automobile dealership has started using Uber to transport customers to & from the dealership's service. Fifty minutes ago, \"Steven,\" my projected Uber driver, texted me he would \"arrive in 22 min in a Honda Accord **\" [Massachusetts] and that I have only 2 minutes for the pickup. Fair enough! I waited thirty minutes outside in the cold before my dealership called and told me that the driver had since changed his mind because I was inconveniently far away. The contact ph# **, provided in the text, was a NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE line, but one that demanded an account # & country code, though it wouldn't have mattered since the window of time to enter the data was too short to be effective. I miss having ready service of a true taxi!\n",
      "After ordering an Uber for a ride to the dealership to pick up my truck the Uber confirmed receipt and was headed to me. The app showed the Uber waiting on me at the pick up but no-one was there except for me. All of a sudden the app showed that the driver cancelled the ride and I was charged 5 dollars. I again ordered another Uber and disputed the charge which they refunded. The second Uber ordered done the exact same thing but I was refused refund. I will never again use Uber and I have downloaded the Lyft app for future use.\n",
      "It's a bad company and the pay sucks. Uber clams that your in independent contractor but in reality your a total employee to them. Example Uber controls your account, the support line sucks, they are a waste of my time. I highly recommend everyone don't ever work for these thieves. My account is on hold for over a week and half for yearly background check up. I did nothing wrong these $#*!heads are pissing me off. They don't pay anything to the unemployment which means no support for you when they hold you account. Uber is a Nasty DEVIL!\n",
      "We broke down in West Columbia, S.C. and had to get a hotel waiting for repairs. My wife downloaded UBER (we have never used it prior to this). A nice, polite man picked us up promptly and we were very happy with the $10.65 fare. After renting a car and returning home I find all sorts of charges (from Calif.), including one for $6,45 and a $99.99 TIP!~ Of course there is no way to talk to anyone at UBER and so far they have done nothing but \"Promise\" to correct it. We will never use them again and advise others to stay away!\n",
      "A little over Two weeks ago, I was a rider in an Uber that go into a car accident when it hit a concrete divider in NYC., myself and my friend were injured and required transportation to the Hospital. We both have several injuries that require medical follow up, my friend suffered from a hairline fracture of her skull and Spin, I have several injuries ranging from concussion to neck injuries as well as knee injuries. My Doctor wants me to get follow up care ASAP but to date Uber has not reached out to use to give us any information. We have tried to contact them multiple times and get a RoBo response that they are taking this issue seriously but nobody has contacted us or given us insurance information. This leaves us in a bind in that we cannot make Dr. apt. without the no-fault insurance information.\n",
      "I have been using Uber for 2 years now. Seemed ok, but recently I was charged for a ride I took months ago (I remembered the amount - 20.04) so I opened the app and looked into trips I've taken and amounts billed. I also checked my Paypal account to verify and double check payments, and Wow I have random charges that do not coincide with rides, I have one account of double billing, and three separate charges for 17.84, 18.84 and 28.46 that have no rides associated with the dates. One was on Christmas day when I know I didn't use that service. I contacted Uber but have yet to hear anything. I cannot find any phone numbers, and the app is not very helpful.\n",
      "I had a promo on my account for at least a few months now. $5 off ALL rides in Toronto. It applied to Pool and Uber X. It would automatically renew. No issues. All of a sudden almost 2 weeks ago I noticed it was only on the Uber X. So I sent a message. They told me it was only applicable to X. This isn't a new promo code. It's the same. That was always applicable to Pool. You can't just change rules. You need to change the actual promo. I know 2 people who still have it applicable to Pool. After going back and forth for almost a week, now my messages go unanswered. Not even the generic message they send. Straight ignored. And I know they're waiting for the promo to expire which is either today or tomorrow. It's absolutely disgusting to have that kind of service. I've been a rider for 3 years. Took Uber EVERY day. It's a $5 promo. Which other riders still have. Sickened at the way this has been dealt with.\n",
      "My experience with Uber has been terrible. There is no way to actually get in contact with customer service. I lost my phone in the back of one of their cars the other day. The only way to retrieve a lost item is to speak with your driver, however, my driver didn't speak a word of English. So I'm unable to communicate with him. Despite repeated emails to customer service explaining this, all I'm getting back are automatic reply email, telling me to contact the driver. Bad service. Will not use again.\n",
      "Yesterday I took 2 Uber, like I typically (if not daily) use. On my uber ride home, everything seemed normal. I had a nice chat with my driver as he dropped me off from a 10 min ride. Hours after, I see my Paypal and Credit card statements, and realize Uber has charged me $150 for a \"Cleaning Fee\". They are suggesting that I made a mess to my drivers car. Apparently, the driver sent them a generic picture of a wet at and charge me $150. Mind you, this extra charge/modification was made some hours after my ride was completed.\n",
      "My driver stole my phone and Uber did nothing about it. I corresponded with their help desk for a week and I only received stock emails. After they were unable to contact the driver, they stop responding to me but they have continued to let him drive under the Uber brand. BEWARE! You may be his next passenger.\n",
      "I used Uber last year and loved the service. I again \"attempted\" to utilize Uber last night (Halloween) for my 16 yr old daughter. Guess what? She ended up stranded miles from home due to YOUR inept incompetence. Needless to say, our Uber days are over. BEST TO BE AVOIDED/NOT CHILD-FRIENDLY! We will be utilizing Lyft from this point forward. Choose your merchants wisely!\n",

      "I've been using Uber for years with no issue. About 6 months ago I started receiving an error message saying 'something went wrong' and could get past the ride search without this error. I contacted customer service via their website form (since you can't email or call anyone to explain your situation). Uber support could not figure out the issue. After 3 weeks of back and forth with the support staff, I had them delete my account and was told I could sign-up with the same email after 30 days. I've since downloaded the app again and cannot sign up using my email or phone number as Uber says it is already in use.\n",
      "The most cunning app I have found so far. I took an Uber lets on Friday. It cost me 34.00 And then next day I requested for Uber the app says I have pending transaction even though I had money on my account. I requested for Lyft. I was able to reach my destination. Spoiler alert get your ** straight Uber. Call me **.\n",
      "Riccardo, Honda Civic, license plate ** in Los Angeles was to pick me up at LAX. Waited only 5 minutes and he texted me to confirm where I was going. He said he would be there in a minute. He pulls up 20 ft from me, and as I walk out from curb he just takes off. I texted him saying, \"Where are you going?\" He said, \"I don't want to take you\" and then charged me a $5 cancellation fee despite he's the one that cancelled it at the last second. Riccardo you're a jerk. Your Uber profile states you drive because \"Need clients to support myself and loved ones.\" Such baloney ya loser.\n",
      "I had been using UBER since 2014, and had been happy with the services until the beginning of 2018. In the beginning of 2018, I would try to request a ride through the UBER app, but for some reason, the request would get denied and there was no explanation at all on the app. After months of trying this, I reached out to UBER a few times through my account and through their Facebook page. When they responded via their Facebook page, they stated that they will send an email to me to my email address. When they sent their email to me, it stated that my UBER account was suspended, but did not state the reason behind it nor did they state the time frame of the suspension. I was never made aware of the suspension until this email was sent to me. \n",
      "Please be careful when using the Uber app. I have had to cancel the second debit card and am still waiting for Uber to refund my account. I found several fraudulent charges. Not only has this happened to me but it has happened to my daughter as well. I will remove the Uber app from my phone as it is apparent that their security measures are nil and that the customers are vulnerable to having their card numbers used for other rides. Since there is not a human being you can speak to and communication is only through emails this is extremely frustrating. I have used other ride apps and Uber is the only one I have had this issue with.\n",
      "After my husband and I spent 50$ on a trip in July and got a receipt for said trip I pretty much forgot about it until a few days ago (October 27th) when PayPal notified us about 50$ coming out of our account from Uber - we panicked, thought there was some kind of theft going on and an hour later got an email from Uber explaining that, somehow even though we have a receipt we didn't pay them and 4 months later, without warning they were taking 50$ from us. I remember this money leaving my account because it was a high cost ride, but seriously at best I'm misremembering and only thinking of the official receipt I got from Uber in which case they should write off their mistake or at worst they are double charging me.\n",
      "I usually take the bus or train to the airport but Thursday morning Uber Express Pool cost only $5 more than my usual bus or train so I decided to go for that. First thing is that Express Pool seems to make you wait 5 minutes before connecting you with a driver. When it did connect me after 5 minutes it told me to walk a block to a nearby corner and the driver would be there in 4 minutes. 4 minutes became 9 minutes, then 11, then 16 and it became clear from the map that the driver was heading to the airport without me. \n",
      "I took Uber in July and suddenly I receive a charge on my credit card October 26. They are billing people for June and July!!!! I received a receipt in July. How is this possible? The number on the credit card receipt for Uber isn't a valid number.\n",
      "The Uber driver broke my luggage when he loaded and unloaded it into the trunk. I was trying to put the handle down to separate the luggage and he said he had a better way not separating them. When he took it out at the drop off he handed me a piece that broke and said casually â€œthis came off.â€ The arena to engage the pull up handle release was broken.\n",
      "Thanks for ripping 60 bucks out of my bank account 4 months after the rides took place. Rides took place in June and July. 4 months later, October 27th you take money out of my account. I already paid it once.\n",
      "Why the price range is jumping? I hate it, imagine you go to the city center for 15bucks. Thats okay, but then you want to come back in the evening and guess what, the price is 50-60-70 dollars. What the hell? Very disappointed\n",
      "My husband and I decided to take the train going to LA Union Station and take UBER to Convention center for my citizenship oath taking. We don't want to be late for my appointment, it's very important, but unfortunately we contacted 3 drivers, but it seems that the 3 drivers can't find us, but we put the right address where to find us and suddenly it seems that the drivers cancelled our rides and on top of it Uber charged us twice for $5 make it $10. Hello Uber? I will never ever use Uber, very disappointed!\n",
      "Fraudulent promotions - I wish I could give them a ZERO rating! I've had many problems with Uber in the past. This time it is it!! NEVER AGAIN! I signed up a new rider using my link and I was suppose to receive a monetary credit toward future rides. They issued it in Taiwanese dollars!! Does that make any sense?! When I emailed them 3x, same generic response, you can't use Taiwanese credit for your fares. Umm I know! Then why did you issue it?! I didn't use, apply, or signed the person in Taiwan!! Seriously the worst company and I don't know how they still get away hiring criminals as drivers!!\n",
      "Never again will I use Uber. While in Vienna, Austria we took an Uber to the city center from a Marriott. The return trip from the city center was a disaster because the driver (Suzana) took us to the wrong Marriott and would not take us to the correct Marriott. She made all 5 of us leave the vehicle. We are 5 women, all 70 years or older, at 10:30 at night, in a foreign city, in a dark and isolated area. We had to get a taxi to return to the correct Marriott. Personal safety is not a concern to Uber and that in itself is a crime.\n",
      "I ordered an Uber ride today going from Lafayette Street and Worth Street in lower Manhattan and going to New York Pennsylvania Station. I was instructed to meet the driver at the corner. After waiting for some time my mobile phone alerted me that the driver canceled. I then ordered another car and it said that the car would arrive in 8 minutes. After waiting about 20 minutes there was \"NO CALL and NO SHOW\". I found myself having to take the subway of which I was trying to avoid. \n",
      "I urge you, do not use Uber. They are well known but as you use them please be sure to look closely at what they are charging and when they are charging. I strongly emphasize on the when. They charged me on a ride I never used even after I said they are not authorized to. I have record of the trip history as canceled just 2 seconds of calling for a ride and they blatantly ignored it. Never addressed that this was an unauthorized charged. 90 days after this trip, I was sent an email 3 days ago from them stating they will charge me because their system made a mistake. Shortly after this, I figured out that their loophole is to close the account 30 days after your trip so you cannot dispute it then send a notification 90 days later saying their system made a mistake to a ride that will be charged 14 days later. \n",
      "I wouldn't even give this \"company\" one star. First of all, their drivers always cancel my pool trips because they don't want to do pool trips and then I have to deal with the cancel fee and the trip money they take. Apart from dealing with this all the time, about a month ago I was out with a friend and my phone wasn't working so my boyfriend called an Uber for me, about a week later we realized that they had taken $150 out of the account because of some cleaning fee. They sent us a picture that looks like someone spilled water on the door and they said that was the reason. So we told them that I didn't do that and that that could be some random picture taken by their driver and they didn't care. They are not giving me my money back. They didn't even send me an invoice detailing the reason why they were taking that money, I had to ask them. So they basically stole my money. Be careful people. This guys don't care about you, they just want your money. I already deleted my account, I'm riding with Lyft from now on, I've never had a problem with them.\n",
      "My account was cloned, so I have having money taken out of my account for Uber trips and Uber Eats that I did not make/have.I tried using their Uber_support twitter account, and received the same automated message over and over.I then wrote back, and didn't get a reply. I then replied to my reply, and my issues was apparently taken to the appropriate team. Who then sent me the same automated message.I tried to again explain my concerns, but continued to received the same automated message.The charges still continued to come out of my account. When I messaged them about this, guess what.....THE SAME AUTOMATED MESSAGE.Terrible customer service!! If I could have given 0 stars that's what it would have been.\n",
      "My daughter's Uber account was hacked and you cannot find a single number or chat to have a conversation with Uber directly anywhere. Uber appears unreachable unless you have a safety issue with a driver...otherwise they appear completely unreachable by design.\n",
      "Uber has hold the full payment for already cancelled trip. They did not void the payment. Be careful when you used Google Pay to do Uber payments. If we cancel the trip, Uber will hold the full amount. They will not refund it.\n",
      "I'm going to share a story about why I will never use Uber again. A month ago, my Uber account was hacked. In fact, AMEX confirmed to me that they had SEVERAL people calling in to say their Uber accounts had been hacked that week. Nothing on the media - strange? Within a 4 day window, 118 rides were charged to my credit card in USD - each totaling over $120+ CAD... Resulting in $8,200 of wrongful charges to my AMEX (thankfully I have fraud protection on my CC, so it was on Uber's end to stop the charges). Even though I alerted Uber immediately when it happened, it took them 4 DAYS to STOP the charges from being incurred/charged to my card.\n",
      "A short while ago my social media was hacked, and it expanded into many of my accounts (Uber being one of them). I then went on to delete my account but Uber has a policy of leaving the account open for 30 days after for possible reactivation. This led to the hacker reopening my account and using my credit card. I have since had to change all my cards. After trying to find a number to call (which they do not offer for riders) I emailed them to try and get my account deleted immediately. After 3-4 emails back and forth with them all they have done is \"refund my money\" (which they said was completed, to a card that is no longer valid) and mark my account for deletion in 30 days (allowing that individual to open my account at their leisure). I would not recommend this service to anyone if they value their privacy.\n",
      "Unfair cancellation fees charged by Uber to customers. Uber is constantly harassing me with wrong cancellation fees for cabs which are getting booked far away from my pickup location where drivers refused to come. So I am charged fees for such situations.\n",
      "I have been using UberX twice a week, every week since July 2, 2018. On Monday morning I use Uber to go from my house in Mississauga to Pearson Airport, and on Friday early evening I use Uber from Pearson Airport back to my house in Mississauga. Every Monday and Friday exactly at the same time and the same route. Every time Uber charges me different fare, not even two times were the same or even close. Last week they decided to charge me extra money three days after my trip to the airport for unknown and unexplained reason. Uber thinks they can charge you anytime because they have your credit card information. It's completely a rip off and totally inconsistent charges for the same trips at the same time. I decided to cancel my Uber account and use regular taxis or Lyft; no more Uber anymore.\n",
      "Uber needs to understand that their cab pooling service is very time consuming for passengers. The drivers go even 1-2 kms off destination route to pick up and drop other pool riders. Kindly understand, this is very time consuming and we don't reach our destination early. Not like the fares are super-low that we have to bear this kind of torturous service. It would be awesome if Uber pool services are far more efficient, in the sense, each following pick up should not be of 5-8 mins of difference in terms of distance. In this way, more people will use pool services and add less to traffic jams. Uber should not just focus on making money but also contribute to lesser vehicles on roads which is very necessary in cities like Bangalore which is overflowing with traffic. Kindly do make an impact by bettering pool services and reducing cab fares.\n",
      "Today I booked a ride from I.D.A pharmacy. Driver was waiting in a different lane. When I finally found the car and sat in the car. Driver started arguing with me. He said that he is canceling the ride and I need to book another car. If I got get out of the car he will call the cops. He forced us to come out of the car. He came out of the car and was standing at the door until we came out of the car. How can someone cancel the ride and threaten us like this. Drivers get paid because of customers and this is how drivers behave. This was the worst experience as I was waiting 10 mins and he canceled the ride. Driver's name was Sherif and his cab number was ** Ford Focus. Trip was canceled on 20th oct 2018 at 1.28pm.\n",
      "I joined Uber as prospective rider in case of my car failing and placed money into an account that would be drawn from for each event until expended. I then tried to delete my subscription/acct as an experiment and was told no money would be returned nor sent to a new account once I deleted existing acct.\n",
      "Usually I travel to DFW airport daily for my job. Yesterday I rented Uber just as I do everyday. My driver was Glorelys. I am deliberately writing this review in order to educate consumers and since Uber has monopoly is U.S. and they feel nobody or no review can harm their reputation. This, Glorelys was new immigrant from Venezuela. I just don't want to discriminate, but because of my experience I asked her when did she moved to U.S.? She didn't know a single word of English. She was talking in Spanish with me and authorities at the airport. Though I was guiding her on right path, she didn't heed my advice since she didn't understand English. She roamed around airport for 1 hour and Uber charged me $12 more than usual charge. I was late for my job. Instead of giving me refund, it charged more for driver's fault. \n",
      "After many attempts explaining my situation, it became apparent that Uber has among the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Many contacts with Uber regarding this issue, here was my final attempt to receive fairness from this company. Actually my final attempt was today, Oct. 15, 2018 where I was advised that my claim is too old, their final excuse to keep my money. I began this process within a week of the trip. Here's my story...\n",
      "I ordered an Uber and the driver was very nice so I tipped him atter. I kept getting error messages while trying to tip saying that it wasn't going through. I waited a few minutes, tried again, and success. The next day I checked my bank account and saw that I was charged the tip twice. I messaged customer service and they credited the money to my Uber account. I wanted a refund because I rarely use Uber and I just wanted my money because I only authorized a one time tip. After many back and forth messages they still refused to refund my money. I will never use Uber again.\n",
      "I took Uber like I have many, many times before. I was taking my dog to the groomer and he was on my lap. He met left my lap and I carried him out the car. Needless to say he never made any mess. A day later I received notice from Uber that they had charged $150 dollar cleaning fee plus the regular fee. I emailed them and they sent me fraudulent pictures the driver had sent them saying the dog urinated on his rug. The picture was clearly the front seats of the car and I was in the back seat. Uber still said they believed their driver and would not refund me the money.\n",
      "Booked 22 hours in advance no one showed up. Bad as that was, support and help department said: \"We're sorry to hear that your driver canceled your trip and that this delayed getting you to your destination. I can confirm that no cancellation fee was charged on this trip request. If you were referring to a different trip, please let us know.\" Well that was nice of them. Then (obviously a form letter since I did not pay anything): \"We understand your concern. We know this is not the news you were hoping to hear, but we will not be able to refund this fare due to it not being within our standards. Thank you.\" So, Uber has no policy if no one shows up after an advance booking? Won't be doing that again. Lyft next time.\n",
      "I would give Ron, uber driver from Sante Fe negative stars if I could. On Oct. 12, 2018 we requested a uber driver to take us from our hotel to Sante Fe airport at 5:30am.The driver showed up, and intrduced himself as Ron. He seemed nice enough. My wife and I got in back, and proceeded to the airport. As we're driving, my wife and I are making small talk with him(where you from, how long you been an uber driver, and so on. Said he was from NY, and had been driving for uber in Sante Fe for 4 years. He started talking about tips, which I thought was very inappropriate. He said he buys water and hand sanitizer for his customers. I said ya, looks like a wet bar back here(lol). His demeanor  quickly changed. He said \" you people are invading my privacy.\" HUH! You \"have no bussuiness invading my privacy RIGHT, RIGHT\" (yelling at us) SCARY! We said we're just making small talk as he continued to yell at us. Finally, I told my wife I need to record this. He heard this, pulled over, and told us to get out. It was 5:45am, 40 degrees in an area that was dark no street light or bussinesses miles from our destination.He opened my wives door, and rudely told her to get out. He threw our luggage into the street and drove away. My wife is 65, and has a sling on her arm after a surgery. We didn't know what to do. It was our first uber ride, and I'm pretty sure our last.\n",
      "Sorry i have to review Uber Eats on this site, but cannot find any way to write a review on uber.com or ubereats.comPathetic!Speaking of pathetic, my Eats order was delayed 5 minutes at a time for over an hour, and then the order was cancelled.  BY UBER!!  WTF?!As the customer, i thought i was the one who could cancel.  I've never been fired by a merchant.  I spoke with both Mae and Jose (a girl) and they even told me they have had similar experiences as \"customers\" of Uber Eats!  Seriously?!when your own employees complain about their employer, things are broken!\n",
      "First and foremost there is no phone number to contact Uber. Is that legal? Second of all, I have used Uber about 20 times. Great idea but what they do not disclose is that on top of the charge that you pay when you schedule a ride they add an additional charge usually under a dollar. For WHAT? Example: I just scheduled two rides, both for a friend about 30 minutes apart. The first ride was 14.67, the second ride was 15.37. I checked my account and they charged me .40 for no apparent reason and .12 for the second ride. They do not tell you what it is for but it is an unauthorized withdrawal. Pass this information on. How long will customers allow ourselves to be ripped off? It shows how absolutely lazy we have all become to even allow these companies to continue to rob us.\n",
      "I have a disability which limits my walking. I can't drive due to severe nerve damage and uncontrollable reflexes. The closest store to me is a Family Dollar which is .02 miles from my house. The cost for me to Uber there is $6.50-$7.50. Along with all other companies promising cheaper pricing to make conveniences more affordable is yet another lie. After putting Taxi Cab Services out of business, rates skyrocketed. I can't say how so very disappointed I am with Uber. I have an upcoming surgery which I pray will be a success. I would love to be an advocate for anyone having to utilize transportation services due to no available bus routes so they may travel when needed at a fair price. I use to take Uber to work, the last two years I've paid a private driver to transport me to work, which is cheaper than Uber (12.4) miles 5 days a week. I haven't been able to work in the last 27 days and would appreciate the use of affordable transportation.\n",
      "I ordered an UBER by entering the facility name on Monday. There was no issue with arriving time and price, then I confirmed it. However when I arrived there, it was not the one I wanted to go to. I definitely entered the correct facility name and the name of building I arrived was not even same name as I entered. Also I had to add the correct address by myself and they charged me again. I'm sure that the address UBER programmed into their system was wrong and they took me to the wrong place (driver was nice).\n",
      "Uber has made transportation much easier, however, it is overrated and expensive. Uber only cares about $ and drivers but does not care about customers at all. First there is not a phone number to reach if you ever encounter any kinds of problems. Only 10% of drivers are actually nice and professional. Uber taking your money when the driver cancels the ride is just ridiculous. Uber should not cut $$ from your account even if you cancel the ride. If our ride cancellations affects the drivers, then Uber should be able to solve that issue for drivers. Customers should not be paying even for a single penny, if they don't use the ride.\n",
      "On Sunday I booked an Uber from Ghatkopar to Vasai at 9 pm. The Uber driver's name was Anand, white wagon R. He arrived on time. When he arrived he asked me where the drop was. I told him it was Vasai so he said he couldn't travel that far because he stays in Panvel and needs to go home. I asked him why did he take the booking then he said he didn't know the drop location. Then I was stern that I will not cancel the booking so he said that someone was unwell at his home so he had to go urgently (I know he was lying). \n",
      "Uber drivers made me feel unsafe. I had one Uber driver harass me and kept calling after the fact I cancelled the ride because he had me waiting over half an hour and then called said he drove to wrong place. Most drivers are rude and somehow there's always an issue with the app, then they don't have customer service or a number where someone can be reached if there is an issue. And when I emailed Uber about the driver making me feel unsafe since he kept calling me and harassing me, their only response was to block the driver or call law enforcement. They need to fix the app and thoroughly background check these people they hire!\n",
      "Worst thing with UBER is that they do not have any REAL TIME SUPPORT. If anything goes wrong you have to fight with the driver and then take out time later on to sit and write a complaint and in reply all you will get are saved templates!!! I had to book and cancel six cabs back to back because driver denied destination and also denied cancelling the trip. And then the funniest thing is after all this UBER blocked from booking any more cab. It's like you go to a shop where the sales guy refuses to sell and then the Owner comes and ask you to leave because you did not buy anything. Is this BUSINESSES or MADNESS?\n",
      "I had a problem with a driver cancelling and being stranded on the street corner with no ride. I asked support if there was any way to schedule rides so I didn't experience cancellations among other concerns. I got a form letter response saying that the $5.00 I was charged for not getting a ride had been refunded (I already knew that). The email for Uber customer service does not allow for two-way communication. I guess Uber can provide nothing and call it customer service anyway.\n",
      "I used UBER yesterday for a ride to my home address. After 3 mins in the car, I realized the traffic was too much so I asked the driver to drop me off at the nearest train station instead, which was just 7 minutes away from the spot where he picked me up. My wife booked the UBER thru her phone so I assume the driver would change the drop off location on his phone. An hour later, I receive my Uber receipt for a staggering $60.46!!! I was shocked because according to the receipt, the driver stated that he dropped me off at home which is a lie. I cannot believe they would lie like that and charge me $60.46 for a 7 minute drive. I try contacting Uber four times over this matter but they are not resolving it.\n",
      "While on vacation in Europe, my wife and I were in an accident in an Uber. It was clearly the Uber driver's fault. Very nice guy, accidents happen. When contacted by Uber they said they would refund our trip, duh. What about the time spent on scene (over an hour), the emotional distress of seeing the other party carted off by ambulance and having been in this traumatic experience. I was just looking for a few credits, not a federal offense. I was told there was no way to determine the amount of compensation for this type of thing. Time to start using Lyft.\n",
      "I left my iPhone yesterday Oct. 2, 2018 in an Uber. Uber makes it impossible to retrieve item as you can't talk to a live person but must submit via phone (which I left in car) or online only to get a response 24hrs later it's been resolved. I asked for the driver to call me back and got NOTHING. Never ever use Uber again. They exploit their drivers and steal your stuff with no call back. Worst company ever and can't wait for them to fail. All I asked for was a call back from the driver which they promised and never did. Now I have to go back to Vegas without a phone and all my data.\n",
      "Uber is a total rip-off. They scam drivers every day. You always see premium possible for long pickups but never get them. This means it should be a surge because no drivers are in that area. I have copies of all the premium possible trips and never get premium but charge rider a big premium. My last one was a 2.7 mile trip that took 5 minutes. Had to drive 18 minutes to get there and almost 5.5 miles. The rider paid 14.26. I got 5.43 and that included a 1.70 long pickup! Anyone who says they aren't screwing drivers is either an idiot or a troll for Uber! That is criminal. I have pics of every one. What rider would pay 14.26 for a 2.7 mile ride that took five minutes??? Had to be surge! I had to drive 18 minutes and 5.5 miles to get to rider.\n",
      "I ordered food, and it was supposed to be delivered at 6:55pm. At 7:10 the driver, Tariq, contacted me that he could not found my address (5 min from the restaurant), already on Uber website. I gave him some instructions on how to find it, and he told me I gave the wrong address. Another 10 min and he call again that he was lost. When I try to help him, he told me that he could not waste any more time on my order, because he was losing money every minute. He told me that he was canceling my order. I called the restaurant, reorder the food, and went there to pick up. I was parking on the restaurant when the Uber driver calls again, at 6:40, telling me he was in front my house and I wasn't there to receive my order. I lost it. I told him to feed the food to his dear mother and leave me alone. What a bad experience. I will never order from Uber again.\n",
      "Venmo sent me an email with a code for $10 off an Uber ride as a celebration for being able to use them as a payment method. I applied the code to my account, took a ride, the code didn't apply. I asked Uber support why and they said I had to make sure payment was on Venmo. Alright. I took another ride and made sure Venmo was my payment, still nothing. Contacted Uber support over 7 times and got answers ranging from, \"we don't know what ride you're talkkng about\", to \"select your payment method to apply credit\" to \"This code expired\", \"We're unable to refund or credit this ride\". Basically, they refuse the email fine print from Venmo and don't care that there was a promo code that was supposed to work on their platform. Very poor service.\n",
      "I was quoted $6.25 for my ride and charged that. Hours after my drop off I received multiple notifications of a charge of $16.14 and $9.87 being charged to my card for my one ride. Yes 3 separate charges for one Uber express pool ride. I immediately filed a complaint which really only wasted my time and pissed me off even more. I was bounced from rep to rep and had to restate the same information over and over and OVER again. The last rep made it seem like she had resolved the issue until today when I saw a pending charge of $16.14 on my company card which is linked to my Uber account for business travel. \n",
      "Today I left my cell phone in the Uber. Every avenue I have taken to try to contact Uber has led to a dead end. I need the verification code sent to my phone in order to login from my desktop. But I do not have my phone. So I cannot get the verification code. There is a page purportedly just for resolving this issue. But it no longer works. I emailed customer service for help getting into my account and at 12 hours later, I have not had a response. I emailed them all day, actually. I called the only number available. That number is for drivers. There are no telephone numbers for riders unless you have the app on your phone. But I don't have my phone. The lady on the driver line promised to help me, then she put me on hold for 40 minutes. So I finally hung up. While I was on the driver line, I heard all the things Uber is doing for their drivers, as a \"driver centric company.\" They do not care about the consumer at all. This is wrong. Just plain wrong.\n",
      "I took an Uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car. I contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app. He confirmed he had the cardigan. He said when he is back in my area he would drop it off. I did not hear back for a while so contacted him again. He said he would drop it off to me but I'd have to pay almost £45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the Uber offices in Canary Wharf. I then asked he drops it off at Canary wharf. I also asked that he let me know the details I will need to collect the item. My fare to the hospital was £7 by the way. Anyway, the driver whose uber user name is \"Abobacar\" stopped responding to me. I contacted Uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail. So I suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so there's nothing they can do. I filed a Police report and the Police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf. I relayed the message to Uber but they declined. A few weeks after, Abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing. So I asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item, they did not respond to that. The moral of the story is, if you have a problem with an Uber driver Uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it. They appear to have a finders keepers policy. It is disgraceful. I still use Uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as I get a chance to find one. Also, I will send an invoice to Uber as advised by the police. I will follow up with feedback at a later date. Beware of \"ABOBACAR\" the Uber driver!\n",
      "I have been driving for Uber for about 6 months now, and they are horrible. When I try and cash out on fast pay it's always something going on with their site. I really hate that when you call them nobody knows nothing. I sit online with Uber for over an hour and nobody even came back to the line. This company needs to be close because they are inconsistent and does nothing for no one other than Uber. I would not recommend them to nobody not even my damn dog.\n",
      "I booked my Uber cab from Cantonment railway station to Bengaluru airport. After my ride gets started, my driver received a call from other customer for pickup. Suddenly my driver asked me to get down and book for a another cab. I ignored him and asked for the reason. Then I come to know that he is working for both OLA and UBER. The 2nd customer is from OLA request. I confirmed this from OTP option asked before started ride. Then I requested the customer to drop me first as I am already delay to my flight. Finally the driver not dropped me in the actual destination... hence I missed my flight... At last my important official meeting got canceled because of me. I am demanding from UBER at least to refund my missed flight charge 3500/-. I am not getting proper response... Feeling very bad about this... Need justice else will go to any extend to get back my loss.\n",
      "I was exceptionally satisfied with Uber until yesterday. On reaching my location, my app showed a payment amount. The Uber driver requested a higher amount than the app request. I paid what the app showed, and the cash function on my account was revoked. Follow up customer service? Was shocking despite me using the service daily. Wrong platform to answer the query, electronic response. Nobody can or will assist with a genuine query. I've installed Taxify.\n",
      "I have never had an issue with Uber in the last two years of using their service until two days ago, when I scheduled a ride the night before. Upon entering the details, a window popped up on the app indicating a Pick Up guarantee. If the driver did not show up within the window of time allotted, the passenger would be credited $10 for a future ride so long as it met the eligibility criteria. My driver exceeded the window of time and arrived later. As a result, I was late to arrive for my appointment. I wrote to customer service and requested the credit. The rep stated they would credit $5 instead. When I quoted their policy verbatim, the second rep stated they would not be paying any additional credit. 24 hours later, they still haven't even credited the $5. It's annoying that as a loyal user with a pretty good rating can't even get something like this resolved, and in line with Uber's policy.\n",
      "No problems with the riders. Uber app charged the incorrect card at the end of the ride, despite profile setup. No big deal here. I requested the charge to be switched to the other in the account and they could not make this basic transaction in more than 10 days I left the ticket open. My periodic follow-ups were useful only to be told that a specialized team was looking into it. I never asked for troubleshooting details but only for the charge to be switched between the cards registered in the account. Customer service just bounced me back every time with no excuse, given the type of request. I could not add that ride to my expense report in time to be reimbursed by my company as it was a business trip. Thanks Uber for that!\n",
      "Worst case scenario with Uber is that they don't have customer care number available in India. I paid twice for a ride as I have booked a ride and paid via my debit card and transaction had done but Uber shows me an outstanding payment of my ride and when contacting them via email they response very slow. Plus when I finally got a call from them they said, \"We have blocked your card and to remove that send us the transaction script\" and even after sending them they said that it's not proper and after sending them one after another mail but still I don't get any reply. I am very much sure that Uber should be banned in India till they got a customer care office in India.\n",
      "As Uber driver in North California. This is second time happen to me in within six months. I got a text message from Uber says they identified improper use of the app as a result they remove my promotion from my earning period and will deactivate my account if similar problem occur again. I talk to support customer service. They send my case to an expert and after waiting for 36 hour for their reply and demand them to explain to me what mistake I have done in order to avoid doing it again because I really care about my job as Uber driver. They seem to be careless and sent me same message. They send earlier like robot message.\n",
      "Uber driver stopped then drove off without explanation and cancelled my trip once he saw my grandmother was in a wheelchair. When making a complaint they said they would look into it but could not tell me the outcome. Disgraceful company.\n",
      "Uber has no customer service phone number. The only way you can communicate with them is by email. And it usually takes 4-5 days to get a response. My Uber account continues to be hacked even though I removed the app from my phone months ago. I am getting fraudulent charges on my credit card, but I cannot get Uber to help me. I just want them to delete my account completely so I don't have to keep getting new credit cards.\n",
      "I book cabs through Uber app a lot many times. Some experiences was good some was bad but my recent experience with Uber was just nuisance. I have to take my sister to the hospital as she was not feeling well in the evening, so I booked a cab via uber. The distance was hardly 3-5 km from my pick up location to my destination. First it took 10-15 mins to connect me with one driver when my pick up point is very near to the main highway (less than even 1 km). And 10 around cabs are always available in this area. \n",
      "I was given a fare of 6.31. I was billed 26.31. After I reviewed my trip my destination address totally wrong. I have been writing back and forth with them for 2 days. Now they cannot seem to get it right. I was wrongly charged again after their review. Was given a partial refund. Then they wrote me saying I will get the rest. I am still waiting. This is just a unneeded pain in the **. Horrible cust service. I will be trying Lyft.\n",
      "Customer service on the part of Uber completely sucks. Had problems requesting a ride twice that system errored, got locked out of my account because of your errors. Went through help to unlock it and it errored twice. Again same EXACT problem. Tried help again. ZERO response from customer service the second time even after following your prompts online. Bad for business when people are trying to use the service first time on vacation. Ended up having to use taxi service. It's over 12 hours later and STILL no response from Uber. Hope they end up out of business. Will certainly be reporting poor ratings anywhere & everywhere I can including BBB & state attorney general.\n",
      "Uber Support in USA is basically bunch of_x000D_incompetent idiots. They are polite, and that is only positive thing one can_x000D_say. But they have no clue about anything, totally useless and waste of time. My experience: I was having problem with uploading documents_x000D_and updating account. (I uploaded documents, but it was not getting approved even though everything was in order). I called Uber support *******069-   First time I called, they reviewed documents, told me everything_x000D_is fine and it will be approved within 2 hours-  Next day I called again (as it was not approved) , they_x000D_reviewed documents, told me everything is fine and it will be approved within 24_x000D_hours-  It was not approved so I called third day, now they told me they can not approve it and I need to go to Greenlight hub  in Toronto, to submit documents there , do_x000D_(again) background check (even though nowhere on web site was asking for it) -   I did go to Greenlight hub  in Toronto 9 days ago. They were fast, professional took my documents, updated it, did a  background check and said it will be 5_x000D_days to get results but after that it is all good and I should be able to continue_x000D_driving with no problem-   (because you can not phone to Greenlight hub  in Toronto)  I called Uber support today hoping to be able to verify simple thing : Did they get results of background hack and if everything is okay.  Incompetent loser on_x000D_the other side took a time to \"check\" and then said background check is okay_x000D_but he kept repeating like a parrot \" we are in process of reviewing and it_x000D_might take 7-15 business days\" .  What are they reviewing  he was not able to explain.Conclusion: calling Uber support is total waste of time, they are useless bunch of morons\n",
      "As a rider all is somehow ok but as a driver this company is the biggest scam ever... They will use you, abuse you and throw you like a piece of trash after you get just a couple of traffic tickets, claiming on your driving record that even the non moving violations are moving violations for them... This nasty company full of thieves will steal drivers' tips and tolls and squeeze out of you and your car all they can before kicking you away...\n",
      "In June, I ordered an Uber car to pick someone up at Marseilles Train Station and bring them to an address that was one hour away. The screenshot of their quote showed that the cost would be between 192 and 254 Euros. There was absolutely no mention of a surcharge. They then charged me 471.02 Euros ($742.47 CA) saying the ride was at a high traffic time. It was 10:30 pm at an almost deserted train station. \n",
      "While traveling Europe I spent over 500 Euro with Uber. They overcharged me on 25% of the trips I made compared to the quoted price given on phone app, after the ride was completed. One instance they quoted me 40 to 50 Euro and charged me 70 Euro! Over a 100 Euros were spent from overcharges compared to their quoted phone app price. This seems very dishonest to me.\n",
      "A promotion was offered in my area to sign up as a driver for uber 200 dollars extra if 100 rides were completed in a month... I completed 100 rides in 10 daysbut never recieved my bonus... So i called uber driver support... Who hung up on me 3 times then transfered me arround their office as i asked to speak to their managers... With them all saying i never opted into that bonus program so i wouldnt be getting it... After i asked to speak to a manager for the third time the male i was speaking to said he was the highest up in management and that he had herd my problem amd wouldnt be doong a thing about it and that he didnt have any more time to spend on the phone with me and he hung up again....   Here i come lyft.... No wonder there arnt enough uber drivers... Now there is one more less.\n",
      "I have been unable to use my uber account for over a week, they cannot send a verification code to my phone, i tried a friends number, still not working, I called my provider, SMS messages are permitted, an after 16 emails to uber m they are still telling me they have a new team working on it and will resolve it, I have asked them to call me several time as  they have numbers on their site   that are definitely not uber.  I cannot believe such a company gets away with this , they do not deserve business, I feel bad for their employees, I will be usong Lyft from now on!!\n",
      "I have attempted to set up Uber on my phone for a month now. It kept saying that my number was already registered. After multiple emails to the company explaining that I have not register my number and sending all the information they requested it never got resolved. It is a waste of time, useless customer service.\n",
      "Humble, Texas. September 15, 2018, I ordered a ride and was picked up by Edwin, driving a Toyota Corolla. The ride was quoted as $11.45. Later that evening, I tried to order another ride and received a message that I owed $35.00 for the previous trip. I requested a review of the fare, because the morning ride is a regular ride to Dialysis, 3 days a week and $11.45 is in the normal range. I received a message today stating that the driver reported a mess made and I was provided with 2 pictures...there is no mess shown and I know a mess was not made because I didn't have anything to make a mess with.\n",
      "My issue with Uber is they quote you a price when you complete your trip and days later the price is different. They don't tell you anything. I started using one card just for them that is how I found out and if you check your receipt it's says wait time or toll surcharge and fees. This is robbery and they need to stop. The drivers are saying they arrive and most of the time they are in the wrong place or they drop you off in the wrong place and pretend they did not hear you say no it's over there. That's stealing.\n",
      "Spent way too much time today setting up our Uber for Business account since several folks from our company are going to be traveling. Sounded like a great concept but after getting everything set up I was informed that they needed three days to process our account. Nowhere was there a mention of that and we've used Uber individually for a long time. So, tried to get some help and they just weren't too concerned or interested in trying to resolve the issue. So account is deactivated and we use another provider who seems to care a lot more about customer service. Just a warning...\n",
      "Since February of 2016, I've been using Uber on behalf of the company I work for to schedule rides for our clients coming into town. I've probably spent close to $1500 in gift cards alone since then. I've never had a problem until yesterday. After two company cards, a PayPal account, and multiple attempts to pay through the app and the Mac, I could not get their system to accept a payment. I confirmed with my bank, that the issue is not the card. In fact, the bank is holding these transactions. But Uber doesn't have a record of them.\n",
      "I tried to add my daughter to my Uber account and ran into numerous problems. I am in CROYDON, PA and my daughter is in Philadelphia PA. My daughter needs the Uber getting back and forth to work. We have messages that the payment needed changed, invalid payment method. There is no customer service # to call so I am dealing with a friggin robot. Robot says they lifted restrictions off my account. My daughter tries to use Uber again and gets a, \"Oops something went wrong!\" Only good part is I can curse out the robot and not get hung up on. Uber needs a customer service representatives, not robots to have any satisfied customers! Uber is a big joke!\n",
      "I had booked a ride to take us from a restaurant on Canal Street, to the West Village. The driver stopped at the wrong place. We signaled him NOT to make a U turn on a busy street: we'd cross with the light. We did. He charged us for waiting time. Then he took the wrong route, and we wound up in New Jersey. We told him he had the wrong route, and he screamed \"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.\" In Jersey City, there was an accident in front of us - a bad one. He swerved, and nearly started a second one. Then he told us \"as a courtesy\" he wouldn't charge the NJ surcharge. After we got back to NY (another \"courtesy\", he wouldn't charge us the toll), he started taking us to Brooklyn. Twice. Again 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING'. Two sixty year olds have to act like James Bond and jump out of the car when it stops, to get away. We were further downtown than when we started. Uber's reaction? \"Oh well, we refunded your fare.\"\n",
      "Took a Uber ride about 8 minutes. The driver was Spanish. 3 hours later get email Uber takes $80 out of my Visa card. Apparently driver says 3 hours later I did damage. This is Uber's cleaning fee then I find out the driver was suppose to be a ** but I called, filed complaint but this is a scam all over Uber.\n",
      "They have little to no  customer service. They have no actual person that you can speak to. They make it almost impossible. I have tried to explain to them in many different ways that they have charged me double for every trip that I have taken, and charged me double the tip for every trip that I have taken, and the money has come out of my bank account, but they still keep telling me that I have an outstanding balance and That I must pay it again!\n",
      "Car number plate: GFI4CZKThis may not reflect the whole of UBER, however, as my first and subsequentially last UBER ride, I think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again. First, he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage (literally 4 shopping bags), despite it fitting with an excess of room, then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount. Rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company. Would recommend UBER to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we, as customers, do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day. It may be amazing in the US but in the UK you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service. If you use UBER and get this number plate, then save yourself the bother and find another car.\n",
      "I've driven for Uber for 3 years and constant battle for them to get fares accurate or my rides disappear completely. And it's always in their favor. And always the bigger fares. I've never been overpaid for a ride accidentally. Customer service is a joke. They act like idiots who can't understand common English and only ever send a canned response. It is the most frustrating customer services I've ever dealt with. Uber treats drivers as though they are expendable. When they list how many miles I drove on a ride it is always less than that what I actually drove according to my GPS.\n",
      "Uber is continually squeezing profit away from drivers by changing their policies. I've been driving for over a year and have a nearly perfect rating. I do a fantastic job for this company and I feel completely unappreciated. I am not alone. Every month that goes by, Uber finds ways to change their policies to be less friendly to drivers, who they call partners. They have made it clear to me more than once that I am expendable. Regardless of the service that I provide for them, they are aware that hundreds of other drivers signed up today, and if I don't like it I can leave. They're changing incentives that we have counted on and taking up to two-thirds profit in many rides. Uber needs to be held accountable and must show their appreciation and value of the drivers who are the backbone of their business.\n",
      "Requested an Uber from hotel on the beach to the airport, about a 45 minute drive. While I was waiting I noticed a car similar to the one I was expecting pull up and three people jumped in. Waited a little longer and then noticed that I was on my way. Someone else had taken my ride. To add insult to injury I couldn't request another Uber until that ride was done, and I got charged for it! No response as yet from Uber, I wonder how long it takes for them to respond. The driver obviously didn't verify who he picked up.\n",
      "Driver took me to wrong destination - claiming I had entered the wrong address. I typed the address into the app, but it defaulted to another address (thanks, Uber). I paid about $12 extra and 15-20 extra minutes to get to the right place. I hate Uber. They just don't get it. LESSON LEARNED: When getting into the car, BE SURE TO CONFIRM your desired destination by exact street address with the driver. Uber's drivers simply follow the GPS in the app and won't ask to confirm. Uber's drivers are stupid automatons. No wonder Uber is on forefront of developing driverless technology... they are practically there already. The Uber app will offer several alternate destinations as you type in the destination address. If you, by chance, tap the wrong one - and don't notice - you'll wind up on wrong side of town. Uber accepts no responsibility. Be careful using its app. Be careful with Uber. They rip you off and you have no recourse.\n",
      "As a former UberEats driver this company has HORRIBLE customer service and most of the representatives cannot comprehend English. They take you around and around asking you the same questions over and over again and they have no respect for the drivers, though they love issuing apologies without solving your issues. They have constant issues with their app and as an UberEats driver your trips REGULARLY go missing and you have to fight tooth and nail for your missing money, IF they even solve it. It sucks when your trips go missing because you then lack proof of the delivery unless you screenshot your trip (which is ridiculous to have to remember to do for every trip) which makes speaking with their unprofessional representatives even more difficult. \n",
      "I got this guy and he charged me and never came. He blamed the GPS when I gave him clear directions then when he finally saw us he drove off and canceled the ride charging me $13 and still charged me plus a $5 fee for driving around. What a scum bag. Spread the word so people know. I don't want this happening to other people I want you all to be aware of what some Uber driver are doing. Be careful and always check your online receipt because they are ripping people off???\n",
      "I linked my credit card to Uber for Epayment purpose but after my travel on 09/08/2018 Driver ask me to pay and I told him I linked my card. It will deduct from my card and driver said that, â€œI am not received money. Please pay cash,â€ hence I paid cash. Now again they deduct from my card also. When I contact help center of Uber they told that cash exchanged outside the Uber system cannot be recorded hence we cannot take account and cannot adjustment are refund.\n",
      "I've been working for Uber for a week, I tried to pay out my funds, it won't allow me to, I've called technical support and each person had a reason why I cannot get my funds. This establishment is very unprofessional. Having a conversation with the support team they will repeat the same thing over and over and no resolution. I would not recommend anyone who doesn't have another income to drive with Uber. Terrible.\n",
      "I ordered a Uber for work 8/28/18. They then sent me the text message saying he would be there in 5 mins. I continued to get dress. Not even a minute after that message came thru it said he was here... so I quickly called the number it gave me and asked him politely for 5 mins. He said ok. I told him where to park. I run out 4 mins later and there is nobody there and It says I canceled the order. I then had it reordered for me receiving the same driver Richard Kia Soul **. It sent me the same message saying 5 mins. I decided not to take the chances and sat outside waiting for him for about 7 mins. When nobody showed up I tried the contact number, took me to the voice over thing. When I checked to see where he was it said I canceled again. Now tell me why would I recancel an order I deliberately just redid?? And when I contact customer service thru the app like it says they don't care!!\n",
      "Uber is fine unless you're trying to cancel a trip. I accidentally booked a trip. I contacted the driver and immediately within 30 seconds and he did not cancel it. I responded again 5 minutes later. The driver did not cancel. He finally told me to cancel after he arrived at my destination. The issue I have is that there's no cancellation button. I was scrolling through every area of the Uber app trying to figure out how to cancel this ride even after I contacted the driver and I could not locate anything. Upon intensive internet search trying to find an 800 number to call Uber directly and being unsuccessful I finally did an online search and was told thru a wiki article how to cancel a trip... to click on a tiny picture of the driver to access the cancel button. This is deceptive practice. I was charged $13.37 because of the driver's time because he did not cancel the ride and I had no idea or information on how to cancel it myself. \n",
      "I have seen the Uber commercial where they claim to do background checks for the safety of their riders. Well I had an incident in 2011 and they hired me in 2017 let me setup my life to drive and support my child and wife and out of nowhere ran a background check and closed my account and I have a 5 star rating and I just think this is unfair and they should have taking care of this before they hired me.\n",
      "Can you believe this? On 26th August I booked an Uber ride in Bangalore (car details is for Driver names Babu driving a Swift Dzire.) The driver was a pig and he made me get out of the car in the middle of the road. I even called the Police number from app and reported a complaint against the driver. Uber Representative called Rishi had the audacity to email me saying that Uber will deactivate my account as I misbehaved... Now let me get this, I a female misbehaved with an illiterate, uneducated local driver who is a male... Hmmm Uber I wish you stop services in India.\n",
      "While visiting Nashville for a concert on August 25th, I scheduled an Uber ride at the quoted rate (iPhone app) of $21.**. We traveled from 5th Avenue, not far from Bridgestone Arena to the Gaylord Hotel. Upon arrival, I tipped the driver in cash, and we exited the vehicle. A few seconds later, I received a notification that I had been charged $79.72! Uber informed me that there was a \"surge charge\" (which I had never heard of) and that it is applicable, essentially when there are very few drivers available, relative to the number of riders needing rides. Supposedly, the rider is notified of the surge charge before accepting or rejecting the ride, but I wasn't. I was simply told \"$21.**\", then charged $79.72. There were plenty of taxis in the area that I could have taken with no waiting. Going forward, I'll routinely be using Uber's competitors when available, then taxis unless it's cost prohibitive, then Uber as a last resort.\n",

      "My husband and I went to the Taylor Swift concert in Nashville TN last night, August 25, 2018. Our Uber experiences have always been great until early this morning when trying to get back to our hotel. I don't understand how it cost roughly $26 to get from our hotel to the Nissan Stadium and $185 to get back to our hotel after the show. That is price gouging and it's illegal! We paid it to get back to our hotel because that was our only option, but that kind of money is needed for the house payment! I am extremely disappointed in Uber! I understand the demand for a ride was high, however 5.7 times higher is unacceptable!\n",
      "I am about sick and tired of Uber and I am just going to cancel all use with them. This is the second time that they have charged me for something without my permission. This ride was $48!!! Why do they do this?! What makes them think that someone wouldn't notice such a chuck coming out of their account?! This is the weekend and I have plans, what if that was all I had to even grab a bite to eat?! Uber is making me sick now and I am so tired of the run around with them. The first time they tried to say it was just an \"authorization\" if it is just an \"authorization\" WHY ARE THE FUNDS COMING OUT OF MY ACCOUNT?! This time, they haven't even replied yet. If those funds pull out of my account, there's going to be a huge problem! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME WITH THEM AND DO NOT KEEP YOUR ACCOUNT ON THE APP, THEY WILL ROB YOU!!!\n",
      "I'm trying to dispute an Uber cancellation fee, and it's apparently impossible to do so on the website. You're told to click the arrow twice and select Problem with Cancellation Fee, but that's not findable. I'm bothered because I was at the location, having booked it just inside the building entrance and then having sat on a bench in front. The driver never called me, which he/she should have done if there was any confusion about the pickup point; I rebooked and connected with the new driver at the same location. Very poor service, I'm heading for Lyft from now on.\n",
      "My name is Clarence **, I was currently a full time Uber driver, Uber decided to deactivate my account which was my bread & butter for more than 13 months straight, I have a 4.90 Uber rating and I have drove more than 4800+ folks with awesome compliments, my bills which included car payment and insurance, rent and etc. My car that I financed a year ago was strictly for Uber, now I'm on the edge of losing my car and other things that matter. Please can someone help me as Uber has deactivated my account for a annual background check, I've been working for Uber for over a year and I have passed the requirements to become a Uber driver, so my question to Uber is why? Why me? And I've still haven't gotten a good response and I've been telling them about my bills and situation and they seem not to care.\n",
      "Beware, when you choose Uber Express Pool because they tell you to go far to meet the driver, and the driver never lets you know he is there. They only give 2 minutes of waiting time. And then the Uber charge you a fee of $6.00 which is more than the cost of the trip. It is a scam.\n",
      "I've decided to write a review only after a second experience of this kind. I will continue to keep close tabs on all Uber charges from now on. The fÃ¬rst time I was charged for a round trip to and from airport at the next pay level up (limo level). Uber was adamant about the charge along with the driver, despite the verifiable fact that had I actually made the trip reported, I wouldn't have landed in another city which happened to be 2 hours away by plane. This was 3 hours after I arrived at airport. The other issue verifiable by Uber's hold on my credit card for the correct amount. Price was double the authorized charge.\n",
      "So I scheduled at 4:15 to 4:25am pick-up from Uber to go to airport. Uber driver notified at 3:50am and dispatched to my house. Driver leaves before my pick-up window, does not tell me he is waiting (neither does App) and I get charged a cancellation fee. I try a second time to locate a driver on Uber but none available and a driver also not available on Lyft. I end up with a taxi and a hefty fare charge. Uber touts that they offer a guarantee that your driver will be there during your pick-up time or they will give you a $10 credit. It took two e-mails to get Uber to reverse the cancellation fee, this happened only after they admitted that their driver left early. Poor, poor driver service and customer service. If Uber will not stand behind their guarantee then how can you trust them to pick you up on your scheduled time? I only ask for accountability and dependable service, isn't this what we are paying for...\n",
      "The booking fee is a phony ploy to enhance the total bill. It is a tactic used by unscrupulous cell phone providers and wifi providers. My experiences with Uber have been very positive but I really resent the cheap shot of adding a \"booking fee.\" It is completely unnecessary, and uncalled for.\n",
      "Uber you really got a good job , but i have an issue that the price in higher. If possible then provide my some offers and discounts.\n",
      "I have used Uber twice and received good service. The drivers were prompt and polite and UBER billed me correctly and efficiently. However, today I had a bad experience. I contacted Uber. I was told the driver was 3 minutes away at a nearby market, which is about 3 minutes from my home. I waited 10 minutes and the driver was still 3 minutes away at the same market. I waited 15 minutes, then I texted the driver to tell them that since they didn't show, I wanted a credit. I had to get a ride from someone else since I was already late for my appointment.\n",
      "The driver has submitted a claim for $150 through the app. After calling him through the Lost Item option on the app and confronting him about it, he claims he has no idea what I'm talking about and that he's \"too busy\" for this. His claims are false and fraudulent, and I will NOT be held liable for a fraudulent scam. I will be reporting this company and your driver to the police for fraud. I will also report you to the Better Business Bureau and raise hell on any and every social media site known to mankind. \n",
      "Whenever I book a bike or cab from Uber they never came in location from which I have booked the cab. They always go somewhere else, the problem with uber is picking up the location. Its app picks up the wrong location and the drivers goes somewhere else, then I need to help drivers to get my location. So here is the incident: yesterday (10 Aug 2018) I booked a Uber bike and I put my drop location, the same location I always puts whether it's uber or Ola and before reaching the exact location the driver says, \"This is the location you have put and I will not go beyond this location,\" I told him that, \"You will need to go from another side. This street is closed to get my place,\" he denied to go. I told him, \"If you drop me on my location then you will be paid otherwise no payment.\" \n",
      "Tried driving for them going on two weeks still waiting on the decal I ordered twice.  By time it comes I won't be trying to drive for them.  Guess it's better then a two week wait from lyft on a background check. Not worth it. Y time you get everything it's the same as waiting 2-3 weeks at a new job for a paycheck.\n",
      "I ordered an Uber and the driver picked up the wrong riders. I contacted Uber and received a notification that I would receive a refund and they never gave me my refund and no one has gotten back to me no matter how many times I have contacted them. They acknowledged that someone else took my ride but still didn't refund the money. Horrible customer service. Or lack there of.\n",
      "I'm really disappointed with Uber for what I feel was â€œpointing of a gun at my face and rip me offâ€ at the very last minute when I needed the service the most. I had book a trip from Madrid to the Airport, I was showed a fare from low to high, I was ok with it, I ordered the service. Less than 10 minutes before my trip, I received a message from Uber saying that due to congestion and demand (6AM and Madrid was empty), I will be charge 50% or more. I received this message and at the same time the confirmation that the driver was on its way. \n",
      "Beware. This company allows drivers to submit fake pictures claiming you made a mess of their cars and will charge you up to $150 extra without even giving you the common decency of a phone call. I was hit with a totally false charge and Uber initially refused to refund me. I did absolutely nothing to the driver or his vehicle yet when this claim hit my email, because Uber does absolutely nothing over the phone, they had already charged me without hearing my side for any details. Please avoid this alleged criminally designed company. They are not worth the headache and definitely not worth your hard earned money.\n",
      "The Uber website states they have a phone numbers for customer service, (not the emergency number, or one out of Singapore), to reach someone 24-7. That is an untrue statement. They take you through several layers, click here, click there, and then back to a website that you have to sign in and create an account. NO PHONE NUMBER!\n",
      "I have never experienced a worse service experience than I have had with UBER both here in the US and on my recent trip to the UK. I don't understand how a company can be allowed to do business when it treats their customers the way I was treated. I got a promotional code from Citibank AAdvantage credit card services to use a promo code so I can get credit on my first 2 rides with Uber. I had never used Uber before so I downloaded the App and proceeded to put in the promo code. I kept on getting error messages so I tried to get a customer service phone number in the US. To my surprise a company as big as Uber does not offer any phone customer service in the US. A multibillion dollar company with NO PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!\n",
      "I do really appreciate the value of the Uber Pool. You can't beat the cost. Drivers are typically very friendly, but the GPS they use is terrible. I usually have to direct them because the GPS is so lacking.\n",
      "Uber is helpful to get around as we do not live near a city bus. We can open the app and see how long a ride will take. This helps the teens and seniors in our family when I am at work. It is competitive and cheaper than a taxi.\n",
      "I had left my phone in an Uber car whilst away on business in San Jose in April, I am yet to have a satisfactory conclusion to my dispute. I went to my hotel room and got my tablet device and went to the Uber website and logged in however, couldn't do anything without an SMS verification which would be sent to my phone which was in the car, so pointless. I downloaded the Uber app on device but couldn't operate anything there. I even logged onto Samsung website and attempted to force my phone to ring but it was out of power. The only way I could get hold of Uber was by writing on Twitter at how bad my experience was and they asked me to private message. I then explained where I went from and to and the times and took a snapshot of the email receipt for the trip. \n",
      "I was very happy with Uber until my last experience when I had a ride with Uber to Kashmiri gate. When I booked the ride I was shown 188/- for my ride. As soon as driver arrived he said it is 285/- fare showing on his app. I thought it will be updated. At the end of the ride driver asked me to pay the amount showing on his app. I showed him it is 188 on my end. He said, â€œYou can escalate it later with Uber. Right now you will have to pay 285/â€. I paid it, also the receipt I got from Uber is still showing 188. \n",
      "Very pleasant drivers, very clean cars, great price too. Overall excellent experience. I will use again and recommend my family and friends to use Uber.\n",
      "I love using Uber. Sometimes the price is higher than the cab service and that sucks. If they were a bit cheaper I would use Uber all the time!\n",
      "I've use Uber for the last 2 years and never complained about anything even when I had small issues. Today I've tried to talk to a human being for the last 4 hours and there is NONE existence!! The automated stupid robot keeps emailing be nonsense - I asked for A ride at 4:30 am and it said driver is 9 min away for $35 rate - after 30 minutes I saw on the app that the driver is struggling to find the place - I called, texted and no response. Finally he canceled. Second driver showed 7 min away with the same rate. The same exact thing except this one the driver at least called. Trust me I don't live in a desert. I've had many rides on the same location. \n",
      "Both drivers were early and courteous. They were both efficient drivers and got us to our destination on time. The only objection was their route of travel. Since it was our first experience we did not know we could have told them there was a faster more direct route to our destination.\n",
      "They don't care about safety. I was a driver for Uber and they all time send me 6 or 7 people and my car only 4 people. When you tell the company this not good for the car and not safe they say cancel the trip. When you cancel the trip they get mad at the driver.\n",
      "Used Uber when we were attending a wedding in CA and they were prompt and the driver was good. Driving on CA highways can be stressful but the driver knew where he was going.\n",
      "I ordered an Uber around 1130pm on July 20, 2018 for a 4.6 mile drive that would normally take 10 minutes. The regular car said it would cost almost $17 and the rideshare option was between $11-12. I opted for the cheaper option to save some money. The app told me the driver would arrive in 5 minutes, I waited in excess of that for the driver, fine. I get in the vehicle and settle in to look at my phone to see the fare jumped to $14.06. I agreed to one fare and Uber charged me over the agreed upon fare. Not to mention the driver drove so slow as if he was waiting for another pickup along route. I arrived to my destination much later than expected. He would stop at stop signs and wait half a minute before moving, it was past midnight at this point and there was nobody on the road. He also drove a route that was slightly longer than another. \n",
      "The only problem I ever had was at Las Vegas airport at passenger pick up. I had to wait almost an hour and had to cancel twice before a driver actually showed they were going to airport. All other places were good.\n",
      "Was a little nervous to use but after I did, I found that I felt very safe each time, very polite drivers, clean cars and felt very comfortable. I was impressed.\n",
      "It has been over THREE weeks now and I have been told several different times by the Uber support team members that someone from their insurance adjuster's office will contact me within 2-3 business days. _x000D_This has yet to happen. My shoulder is still in severe pain and I do not have insurance to have it looked at._x000D_They just keep ignoring me.ORIGINAL MESSAGE TO UBER SUPPORT\"_x000D_Hello, I was picked up yesterday (06/27/2018) at 12:04 in front of the *** in Colorado Springs, CO._x000D_I wanted to bring to your attention something that happened concerning this ride. The driver was great and got me to my job interview on time! However, when he picked me up, I had my backpack and duffel bag with me because I didn't have time to take it to my storage unit first._x000D_Well, he drove a **** which is a very large truck. As I approached the truck he rolled down the window and said that I can just put my stuff in the back of the truck. So I walked around to the passenger side and proceeded to do so. The duffel back was extremely heavy and I had to lift it up to my head and lean over holding it up just to get it into the back of the truck._x000D_Lowering the duffel bag in, I got an extremely sharp pain in my left shoulder like something tore--it knocked the air out of me. I squeezed my shoulder and tried to catch my breath. Then I placed my backpack into the back of the truck and got inside and we left. I was running late to my job interview so that was my only concern at that moment._x000D_I think the driver noticed what happened because once he dropped me off, he quickly jumped out of the truck and replied: \"here, let me get that bag for you.\"_x000D_Anyways, I thought it was just a minor injury and that it would be fine by the next morning. Sadly, that is not the case._x000D_I was up most of the night because I couldn't sleep on my left side at all and anytime that I turned on my side the pain woke me up. I can no longer lift my left arm above my head or reach for anything without screaming in pain._x000D_Because of this, I am terrified that this is going to interfere with any possible job duties, if hired, and/or prevent me from passing any physicals should any job require one._x000D_I am writing you this because I just can't stop worrying how this is going to affect me. I'm homeless and I need to work and it terrifies me that this is going to prevent that from happening._x000D_\"This is the same blanket email that I get from Uber every time I ask them why no one is contacting me:_x000D_\"...an insurance adjuster will contact you in 2-3 business days to discuss the details and claims process... Thank you for your patients.\"Now, it has been nearly a month and the pain is only getting worse. Uber just keeps blowing me off hoping that I will just go away. Well, if this pain would go away then so would I!\n",
      "I've only used Uber once but I had a good experience. They arrived on time, took the shortest route and got me to my destination. He was very pleasant and friendly.\n",
      "The service is great! I trust my children riding with Uber. And the benefit to the community is not measurable, I'm confident the service has saved many accidents and damages to persons and property.\n",
      "I like Uber for the most part. Their prices fluctuate (increase) frequently. There is no phone number or email to get in touch with Corporate. You get charged when the drivers go to the wrong place and say you aren't there. You get charged when you cancel but you don't get anything when drivers don't show and there is no way to make this known. For the most part it is ok but, these are things that have happened to me or family or people I know.\n",
      "Uber is easier to use than a taxi. Instead of trying to find a cab, I just ordered a Uber from my phone and the driver found me. The car was clean and the driver was courteous.\n",
      "I am very impressed with the overall concept of the Uber and the dependability of service. Drivers are personable but not overbearing; courteous and intuitive - every customer does not always want to interact or converse.\n",
      "I have used Uber since they came to my area. The prices have skyrocketed since they first began service here. The last two times I used it, the driver was lost and driving around forever so the wait was extremely long. Besides the price hikes, I really like Uber.\n",
      "Contacted Uber via Phone app for services from address used on multiple occasions. Uber provided four locations for me to travel to be picked up for my ride! Aren't they supposed to pick me up from my location? I ran with arms full of packages to four different locations. The driver was most likely unfamiliar with area, thus the reason for the many changes. I couldn't keep up with the driver's request for different locations via foot. I finally sent a text to the driver for clarification.\n",
      "Uber has really been difficult. I would like to use my account to order food but the number associated with my account is almost 5 years old. I haven't had that number in AT LEAST 3 years but they will not allow me to change it because according to support the only way to change it is through the app. So I download the app and enter my number but obviously that doesn't work cause it's not associated with my email. It is however associated with the driver account I attempted to make but there was no email associated with that account because the process was not finished.\n",
      "The vehicles were all clean over our recent trip to Washington DC. The drivers were all kind and friendly... Overall, it was a much nicer experience than the cab rides.\n",
      "Always quick to confirm a ride no matter the time of day of the location making it very convenient. Use them often to and from the airport, very dependable.\n",
      "I have used several ride share companies and believe it's the best idea for travel, whether short or long distances. The drivers were always on time for pickup and drop-off to all destinations, were always polite, informative, and cordial but most importantly, I always felt safe because they were registered with a business who does background checks, would provide photos of the car and driver, accepted all forms of payment, conveniently provide their app on smart phones, and rating scale for satisfaction.\n",
      "Uber is not only an excellent service, it has been for me one of the most important service I can't live without it, practical and all my experiences up to today very good, with very kind and respectful drivers.\n",
      "Usually excellent. The one time I had a driver who went 2 hours out of the way (while I fell asleep) the charge was enormous. Uber credited me back within 2 days.\n",
      "I usually have good experiences with Uber. Drivers are pleasant and cars are clean and on time. My only complaint is the extremely high rates at peak times. I had one trip where it was $60 to the event and $315 to return home. Obviously, I had to find another way to get home.\n",
      "An Uber account that was recently set up was hacked today with my credit card info being use to charge at least 3 trips in North Carolina, all with the same driver. Fortunately my credit card company's security is such that they caught it shortly after I did and canceled the card. It seems to be virtually impossible to cancel the Uber account. None of the so-called Uber support numbers function nor can one find out how to do it online.\n",
      "I have only used this occasionally in a few cities and each time the experience was well worth it. The description of the car and the estimate of cost were both great. The cars were clean and modern and the driver was courteous.\n",
      "I've been using Uber for years to take trips home from the store. It's a really convenient app for me, especially because I don't have a car. The drivers are almost always nice. I think it's been so rare for me to have a bad experience with someone. Also, probably the one feature I have not been a fan of us is seeing my customer rating, gives me a bit of anxiety. Overall it's a good service. I've almost never had to wait more than 10 minutes too. The prices have gone up but I am thinking (and hoping) this is because they will pay drivers better.\n",
      "The drivers were fine. The problem was I could not speak to a live person. It was very frustrating not to be able to talk to a person. On occasion it took me over 2 hrs to book a ride. Their system went haywire.\n",
      "Uber works. I have used it in several places around the world. It is usually cheap, convenient and hassle-free. However, surge pricing can get out of hand. Also, I'm not convinced that they treat their drivers fairly.\n",
      "Car was dirty inside and the air conditioning did not work. The price was fine but I expected a much more desirable vehicle. I am glad there wasn't some with me because the back seat was full of clothes and sports gear.\n",
      "DON'T EVER USE UBER!!!! They don't hold any of their drivers accountable for their actions and they are dismissive and unprofessional when you try to contact them to resolve an issue or complaint! I had an uber driver damage my BMW in a hit and run and uber did NOTHING to resolve the issue. They couldn't  even apologize on her behalf! I had a description of the driver, her SUV, video footage from the hotel, witness statements, pictures of her car before she fled and they still can't compensate me in any way, let alone apologize! I mentioned that I had to seek medical attention and they don't show any sympathy or concern for my well-being! If this driver didn't have something to hide (i.e. drunk, drugs, weapons in the car etc) then why would she run knowing there were cameras at the hotel and multiple staff who saw her and told she was wrong and she saw me taking a pic of her SUV!? What's even more ridiculous is they don't consider their drivers as their \"employees\"! Read this for yourself \"Driver-partners are considered as independent contractors and not employees. This technically means that driver partners are not employed by Uber Technologies, Inc or one of its respective company subsidiaries.Also, please be advised that the Incident response team is the sole entity in charge of handling all accidents and property damage claims. All claims that we handle are processed based on facts, reason, and logic.This being said, some customers that are emotionally invested in the situation can take this as a lack of empathy. Their need to be heard and understood will often outweigh their ability to focus on the details of the problem.Lastly, if you would want to directly speak to our CEO you need to find a different channel to do so as we are unable to cater to your request. I trust I've been able to explain our position clearly.\"Ps. Pray you don't ever get in an accident with an uber driver in vegas because the useless cops and laws here will allow these drunk/high uber drivers commit crimes!!!! LVPD doesn't give a fck about driving under the influence. _x000D_FCKN UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!! FCK UBER AND CAN'T WAIT FOR THESE FCKS TO GET THEIR DAY IN HELL AND GO BANKRUPT!\n",
      "I was planning on taking an Uber to Midway airport on my recent trip to Chicago. I was planning on leaving at noon. I checked what it would cost me around 11:30. I was quoted $35. 20 min later when I got down to the lobby and ordered my Uber, the price jumped to $58! I switched to Lyft which was only minimally cheaper. Next time I will leave myself more time and take the train! Very disappointed because I really enjoyed taking Uber from the airport. Never again! Taxis are cheaper!\n",
      "I have used it regularly especially in Europe. Found it to be quick and efficient at a fair price. Have only had one issue where language was a major issue and we were put out a mile from our destination.\n",
      "Not a regular user of Uber but the five times. Uber it was convenient, safe, and reasonable priced. Much less than a DUI and paying for airport parking.\n",
      "I gave a tip to a driver and he was almost very thankful, told me it is rare to get a tip because Uber does not encourage it. Most everyone should be encourage to tip if the service is provided.\n",
      "The first time they left me because I wasn't outside fast enough and when I did the app again that morning the price had gone up. Time was of the essence because I needed to get to the airport. I then took a shared ride. That's when I learned what that means and everyone wasn't going to the airport.\n",
      "The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89. There was an option to \"Skip this Step\" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience.\n",
      "The Uber app has the help option but only accommodates a number of preset problem configurations and absolutely nothing outside of it. I had an issue where I was grossly overcharged for a ride. Now there was construction in the area but the driver admitted that he was completely unfamiliar with the area and therefore his lack of knowledge was the more significant reason for my delay.\n",
      "Ease of use is great, being able to not have money change hands and can tip online is a huge plus. The cars are clean and the drivers are respectful. Never have had to wait more than ten minutes.\n",
      "Needed to use it to go to a running store for a Packet Pickup... driver very courteous and good driver on the freeways and to find the place. It only took a couple minutes to get my packet and he agreed to stay and return me to my hotel where I got the pickup from. I was pleased with the service he provided and gave him a nice tip. There was no other potential way for me to get to the Packet Pickup unless I used a taxi and I'm positive that would have cost quite a bit more. Place was about 30 minutes away.\n",
      "Convenience, on-time performance, easy to hail a ride, competitive pricing with a regular taxicab. Helpful drivers too. App also makes it super easy to find a ride in minutes.\n",
      "I buy gift cards for my son and he uses them quite often. I have had problems a couple times, but it is usually on my end. But when I call for help, they are great. They handle it very quickly. He has only had problems with a couple drivers, but other than that both of us are very happy with the service.\n",
      "Uber was a life saver when we needed it. The drivers were all wonderful courteous people but the company was not so great. There is no way to get help or even talk to someone from the company and the app was difficult to navigate. There were added fees like Uber technology fee that were not explained or mentioned that was just taken out of our account. There wasn't even a way to ask about it and the drivers got none of the extra money!! Lastly, I kept getting strange texts for Uber codes after I began the process of trying to be a driver. I changed my mind when I found out someone was already trying to hack my account and rack up an unknown amount of charges on it. I will not use Uber again unless it is like the last time I had to do it an emergency with no other options.\n",
      "The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89.

      "I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Uber at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company.\n",
      "All the convenience of a taxi at half the price. They are there in minutes rather than the unknown taxi ETA. They are always friendly. The cars are usually clean and smell good. I don't ever use taxis anymore. You can schedule a day and time to be picked up too. And that's very nice.\n",
      "I have only had one ride experience I wish not to repeat - I love the ease of getting a ride and the efficiency of the drivers. The costs are always reasonable as well. I will definitely use Uber in my future.\n",
      "Both of my Uber drivers were prompt. The conversation was great! They made my ride very pleasant and enjoyable. Also my car was down at the time and they were a big help!\n",
      "They found me just fine. Only had one time where they couldn't find me, but someone else found me. And I got home just fine. And he waited until I got inside. He made me feel very comfortable.\n",
      "They play around with the prices a lot, both Uber and Lyft. You're using a App and it's not really a â€œcompanyâ€œ. That's customer based oriented and you can just pick up the phone and deal with someone. You're a number and it's not personal. The drivers bare all the cost, they pay for the car, the maintenance, the gas, their time and they are not a employee with benefits. Uber maintains the app but they charge the customer too much and keep too much from the driver. It's up to 40-50% in Uber fees and cost for doing nothing.\n",
      "The driver \"cancelled\" and they charge me a cancellation free!! - I use the App for an Uber to pick me up from a gated community. The application directs me to a pickup intersection about 1/4 mile from my current location (on a very hot muggy night). I arrive there but me driver. After a 10 minute wait, I get a \"ride cancelled\" message from the App. At the time of the message notification, I see the driver on the App about a mile away at one of the entrances.\n",
      "The driver that picked me up was not the driver listed on the app which means there is no security. The driver had lended his car to another to use his Uber. I also brought home bedbugs from the filthy cab. Very dangerous for woman and older individuals...\n",
      "The app and the information it provides are invaluable. I know how much my fare will be, who is picking me up, where they are and the actual route they are taking me. What's not to love?\n",
      "My main complaint would be the fact that each ride are different and prices at different times. Meaning I can go to Walmart today at 5 p.m. from home and it can cost for example $7 then I can go to the exact same Walmart from home on a different date and that ride will cost $13. Or I'll take a ride from home to Walmart and it cost $7 then when I go to get a ride from Walmart to home the ride will cost $13. No. I don't understand how the prices can fluctuate so much.\n",
      "In Las Vegas airport Uber pickup area... The Uber guy told me he was my ride but that was not true. He had another person he was picking up, when they arrived they were too big for us all to be in car. So he made me take my luggage from his trunk and call another Uber. He was Never my driver but I didn't know that. (They all looked alike.) I wish I had his name.\n",
      "I have had at least 2 drivers come on to me in a sexual manner. Another kept calling me at home to go out with him. Don't know how he got my number. Will never use Uber again. Only Lyft.\n",
      "Every time I have used this service I have had a great experience. I have met wonderful drivers who are always friendly and polite. Rates are far better than taxis and much more convenient.\n",
      "We used Uber to and from the airport in Philadelphia in December. It was quick and convenient. But this is my only experience with them. I went with my boyfriend. I'm not sure if I'd feel as secure if I'd been alone. I don't feel like they do a thorough background check on drivers. I've heard too many stories where the passenger is harassed or hurt.\n",
      "I get severe, sudden onset migraines. Sometimes I have to go to the emergency room and there is no one home to drive me there and home again. The Uber drivers have always been very polite, kind, and careful. I have never had any qualms about getting into the car.\n",
      "I travelled with Uber driver Girish on 15th July 2018 in Pune, from Karvenagar to Pune airport. After the trip was completed, the driver asked for amount Rs. 340, and he did not mention anything about charging from my linked credit card. I paid the entire amount of Rs 340 to the driver in cash. NOW UBER IS CHARGING ME SECOND TIME FOR THE SAME TRIP, HORRIBLE CHEATING which is illegal, unethical, immoral and totally unjustified! They have refused to even talk with the concerned driver, and are constantly harassing me to pay the double amount for absolutely no reason.\n",
      "I have had four very good Uber rides. The website is easy to use and a driver usually shows up pretty quickly. I had to wait once because there was no available drivers but the wait wasn't long. So far so good.\n",
      "Uber is easy, less expensive and they don't stink. Always on time, never sultry or obnoxious. Taxis are obsolete and the only time I would take a taxi is if I could not find an Uber ride.\n",
      "The service was great, the driver was appropriately friendly, cost was good too. The car was clean as well. I appreciated the service. I have recommended the service and would use again myself.\n",
      "Uber is fast and easy! There is nothing like it and now we can't live without it! Uber will be here forever! Uber can take you to and from the airport, take you to and from the grocery store, to and from night spots, to and from sporting events, to and from funerals, to and from wedding receptions, to and from the baby showers, to and from Christmas parties, pool parties, New Year's Eve parties, office parties, On and on and on! We love Uber ask a mission point.\n",
      "Am so grateful to have Uber. But wish they had a phone number. The drivers have been great. Cars have been clean and comfortable. I don't drive and will use Uber fairly often.\n",
      "Overall my experience with Uber is wonderful with the exception of my 1st attempt, while I was trying to figure out the app, and got charged for a trip I cancelled within 3 MIN!\n",
      "Although it may be a perception it seems safer. Most of the drivers I have met seem like nice likable people. Cars are much cleaner, not like cabs in Chicago.\n",
      "I have had very successfully rides with Uber. Very dependable and safe drivers. Downloaded app is very easy to use. Responsibly priced and would definitely use them again.\n",
      "For the most part I find the drivers to be friendly, professional and careful. Also, they arrive promptly. However, occasionally a driver speaks about political views which is inappropriate conversation. I experienced this in London but the local drivers haven't discussed touchy topics.\n",
      "Awesome for going out with friends and no one wants to drive because we're drinking. Show you the driver's face and make of the car so you know exactly who's picking you up.\n",
      "The driver was very knowledgeable about the area, great conversation. The car was clean and had a nice scent. He was on time, opened the door and even offered mints.\n",
      "Used Uber on a family vacation in Boston and got great service from where we dropped off our rental car to the north end where having to drive is totally crazy. Driver really knew his way around. I use to live there so I knew he was not going off the beaten path.\n",
      "I took Uber to the airport but on the return trip the app wouldn't work â€” I finally deleted it and added Lyft and took them home. I was really angry after arriving and exhausted.\n",
      "Had problems with Uber app. Driver was great, friendly, courteous and on time, he but had the wrong directions. I wonder if I was overcharged. Have no idea how much I was charged.\n",
      "I like the service. In the app you can track the cab, the driver's picture as well as the make/model of the car. Before you enter you're given a short description about the driver. And at the end of the ride you have the option of rating the driver. Definitely would recommend Uber!\n",
      "I didn't order rideshare but I was charged. My bank refunded my money but I will never use Uber's rideshare app again. There isn't a live person to talk to only email.\n",
      "tried to sign up, this is what happened, not sure why they have banned me :-) the post is quite funny and you can find it here https://goo.gl/gNALhT\n",
      "Drove for Uber for some time and then one day I get a notification that my account is disabled. No explanation or reason to my knowledge. Don't waste your time and money working for these jokers. I sent them information providing all requirements for driving and they just shut down my account for no reason or explanation. They SUCK. Don't be used by Uber. It's not worth it. Time, mileage, wear and tear and tickets, nothing to show for it. A few dollars, not worth it. STAY AWAY FROM UBER.\n",
      "I've used Uber in several cities New York, Chicago, Orlando, Miami, Boston, Las Vegas. I feel safer when I can see a picture and car description in a society where it is so unsafe for women traveling alone. In Vegas it was the cheapest way to get to and from the airport. Boston didn't allow airport pickup but I got one to return to airport, a savings of $20. If the cabs want to compete they need to adjust their rates and make us feel safer.\n",
      "Sometimes impossible or at a minimum, very challenging to find a car in our area depending on time. Also have had issues where the larger size car is not available and we have to squeeze 4 adults into a small car.\n",
      "Very useful, took several short trips, drivers very willing to help, tracking info on smartphone really great, drivers offered to charge my phone, give directions too.\n",
      "While I have encountered a few minor issues, they were indeed minor. I love the ease in calling for a ride, my options in selecting the kind of ride I want [when I do grocery shopping I ride alone so I have room for my groceries & get right home]. Paying & tipping is easy. Every driver has been great; their cars are always clean & modern [never a beater]. Always smoke-free.\n",
      "I saw on the APP, the economy car from NYC to Jersey City would be $46. I arrived and I was sent an email that said I was charged $72. I have been trying all day to get a refund and they will not take care of this. They just keep replying all sorts of random reasons why they cannot refund me, all using different cuts and pastes (Let me clarify, different people are answering the inexplicable reasons, with NO fair explanation.)\n",
      "I've stopped using Uber and switched to Lyft. Lyft is a hundred times better, and everyone agrees to that. It was a rainy day when I requested a trip. When I finished my trip, the next day I was charged $150 as a \"Cleanliness Fee\". I did NOT throw up or create a mess of any kind. But just because my shoes were wet they charged me that insane amount. On asking them, they replied with a photo of the \"so-called-mess\" saying the driver had to clean this up so he couldn't accept rides. There were small yellow petals lying on the mat, that a rider before or after me created. But charging me for WATER?!? The dumb ** don't know that the mat he had in car dries on its own in a few minutes, and he clearly charged me to make that money. I DO NOT APPROVE of this transaction as I did not create ANY mess. It was NOT authorized by me.\n",
      "I have been a devoted customer in Canada and the US. I have had continual operational issues in Calgary. My house in downtown Calgary doesn't even work on their maps. New drivers get lost 75 percent of the time to the international airport. The biggest complaint I have is today I waited about an hour to receive a ride 4 km away from my house. l should have walked. Through their incredible incompetence they charged me a cancellation fee as I'm standing directly under the address sign for over 30 minutes. I just hope people stop using an unsafe and unreliable mode of travel in the future.\n",
      "Rudest, most ignorant and have had 3 or 4 that drive past & LEAVE you stranded particularly IF it IS A RIDE SHARE. THOSE ARE the most economical however some drivers don't want to take them.\n",
      "Fast and low cost service. Used five times so far and always reliable. Sure beats taxis. Drivers were very professional and easy to work with. Paying for the ride with my credit card and the map showing where my driver is relative to picking me up are nice features.\n",
      "We have used this service frequently in several cities. So far it has largely been very positive. Most cars, prompt, clean, safe and the drivers courteous. No major complaints. The timing is sometimes off...they come too quickly and are impatient or are slightly late. For the most part, it is good to excellent. Keep the prices down to have an edge over other taxi services.\n",
      "If there is an issue there is no way to contact anyone except by email. A driver in Tanpa had a car that should have not been approved, did not assist with bags. The day after my flight home, he put in a ticket for a ride which of course was a know-how for which I was billed. I had to email ISO of speaking to someone to resolve this which they did.\n",
      "My grandson who is 19, took care of the computer/iPad stuff in Texas, smooth as clockwork, priced very fair. Both from Houston to Dallas and round trip.\n",
      "Have travelled to Niagara Falls, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles and used Uber. Never been disappointed. Each time the Uber arrived as ordered and at the right location. Each driver was friendly and interacted with us.\n",
      "Unfortunately my Uber account was charged for rides I didn't take. I'm in San Jose, CA and the charges were all the way in India. My initial reaction was to deactivate my Uber account only to find out that the only way to reach out to Uber, no matter how serious, was through the app so I had to log back in to my account. I sent them the details and I received a reply from them after nine days to tell me they will investigate it. It's been a month now and still I haven't heard from them!\n",
      "I needed a medical transportation vehicle. They were the cheapest by far and they were trained professionals. The cost was approximately 10% of what transport services was charging.\n",
      "They don't have a well trained staff, their drivers can come on any of the vehicle (vehicle nos. are different while picking up and different while booking). If ask about original vehicle no. they simply say, \"mai hoon na phone bhi mere paas hi hai kya hua agar gaadi ka no dusra hai toh.\" This is a bad part. It should be same vehicle no. which they show at app or while booking a ride. They also don't care if you make a mistake while booking if, all they require is money. They don't care about customer service.\n",
      "We took it for our first time in Chicago and always were accommodated with the size of our group. They were very prompt, maybe sometimes too prompt but excellent service.\n",
      "Since I don't do any crazy stuff while riding in an Uber car, my experiences have been positive. I see in the news all the time, these people doing stupid stuff while riding in an Uber car. They have no respect for the person using THEIR OWN VEHICLE, to drive them around.\n",
      "I drive for both Uber and Lyft, they take more than 30%, in most cases they take 50%. I have screenshots and can prove that. Only in long journeys they take about 30% but locally they take more. I drive in Wilkes Barre PA where Uber and Lyft are not very popular so on weekdays sometimes I make $5/hour and it goes up to $8/hour on weekend after expenses. I drive a high-miles car so not concerned about depreciation. Uber pays 3.67 as minimum here for up to 2 miles, and most of the rides we get only are the minimum rides. Real examples from my Uber app: The rider paid $7.60, Uber got $3.93 (more than 50%) and I got $3.67. Another rider was charged $9.35, Uber got 4.74 (more than 50%) and I got 4.61. In 10.76 I got 5.90 and Uber got 4.86. Another rider paid 28.35. I got 17.45 and Uber got 10.90. From 11.91 I got 6.84 and Uber got 5.07. From 12.00 I got 7.54 and Uber got 4.46. \n",
      "I have always had a good experience with Uber. There was only one time when the driver drove way too fast. It seems as if he was annoyed to have to do this fair so early in the morning. But otherwise... Uber is great!\n",
      "I love the app. Uber is a great way for getting around and it's still somewhat economical. Great in Dallas but not so good in Tucson where I was not able to get an Uber early morning pick up to the airport.\n",
      "The driver I had was professional, friendly, and personable. He made sure we were safe in his car, got to our destination safely. I would definitely use this car service again.\n",
      "Our drivers, two different ones, were very polite, helpful and interesting. Now I love Uber! We had quite a bit of luggage and three people. Loaded everything in comfortably.\n",
      "Baltimore drivers are not as courteous as Dallas drivers but overall pretty good! About 3-5 months ago it was a problem that my drivers would not show in the early morning hours in Charleston SC that need to be addressed/tweeted; also asking for a tip is not proper etiquette if you're good then it's no need to ask but if you do not acknowledge me as a person I will not tip!\n",
      "I was shown a basic fare for the Uber ride that I booked and the amount is usually same for that route (even with Lyft). The ride was completed and the basic fare was deducted which was fine. However, later Uber decided to an additional 5$ on the base fare giving the reason that the route had a flyover where Uber takes surcharge or toll. I often go by that route but never have I paid any toll or surcharges before. I asked them why wasn't it shown in my base fare or when I booked the ride, they did not have any proper answer. I had attached the response to this complaint. Kindly refer.\n",
      "Uber really sucks. I took a Uber ride a month back and I wanted to get the receipts for the same. Since it was not sent to my email, I was trying to go online and to check it, however the authentication process of \"I'm not robot\" was so annoying. The process goes likes this, it asks you to select the pictures with the keyword that was given in the heading like 'Cars', 'Streets' from the list of pictures. I was doing it for some time, but Oh my god, it was so frustrating that it never ends, it will ask for some more than 50 times and it really tests your nerves. I wasted an hour on figuring this out and I finally gave up with super frustration. Guys... seriously... do you really value consumer feeling. I would request you to please continue only if you do so.\n",
      "I am disgusted with Uber. I been using them for some time now. I added my credit card information on Sunday to pay for a ride. I have 3 credits on there already for Monday morning. Someone in Miami, I live in New York using my credit card for Uber all throughout Miami. Hacked my Gmail account a nightmare. I had to closed all of my accounts. So unbelievable. Uber is not a secure service. They didn't even really apologize or offer me something for free. They should be fine for ** like this. My life has definitely been changed from this experience.\n",
      "As a disabled person, when in SF, Uber and Lyft are often the only choice I have. I prefer to call or hail a taxi, but that's not always possible. However, Uber's existence has caused a marked increase in traffic, making it harder to get around and customer service is non-existent.\n",
      "I had no problem with my Uber experience except the car was very strong smoke smell. Must of been in seats because my clothes smelled like stale cigarette smoke. It was a very nice car, clean, driver was a very polite/courtesy young man. I use Uber and will continue. Everyone has been great.\n",
      "The driver didn't speak when I got in the car, he was very disrespectful. I went out one night and had on one of my good outfits and when he saw me he said something smart about what I had on.\n",
      "I feel I can depend on some other way to travel if I may need an emergency trip, or my car is at the shop. I think they charge a reasonable price. You can probably trust them more than public transportation, not only for safety but for comfort.\n",
      "App was great. Driver responded immediately and came on time. Early am. Respected my need to wake up. Quiet ride and easy arrival at airport.\n",
      "Had my first ride with Uber. I was excited to get 15 dollars off my first ride. You see I have been taking Lyft back and forth most work days and since I am a well known rider my promos are somewhat limited. I spend enough for a car payment every 2 weeks and well I've never had a bad experience and even though most of my funds are used for this type of transportation, not once have I felt insecure or worried that I would be late or even have a thought of not making it at all. Today was a totally different experience. I ordered my ride on the Uber app and even though it's a little different I had no trouble figuring out how to add my 2 stops. I was charged and told my driver would arrive in 8 mins so my daughter, husband, and I waited at the front of my apartments at the office like we always do. \n",
      "We had a great driver last Sunday from LaGuardia to Times Square. The cost was $31. When I scheduled a pickup Friday for our ride back to LaGuardia the price was $51. After waiting for several hours to get some type of confirmation that we would be picked up, we ended up using yellow taxi which was only $45. Just be sure to compare $$ when you travel. Our yellow taxi driver we spoke to the night before at 9 pm said he would be waiting for us at our 4:30 am to pick us up, and there he was waiting when we came out at 4:30 am. That is what I call service. Tried contacting Uber but as you know no calls allowed.\n",
      "I've heard and read plenty of complaints against Uber. Personally I haven't experienced any serious issues, and the minor ones I encounter are usually resolved promptly. That aside, Uber remains one of my favorite apps ever. The convenience it provides is heavenly.\n",
      "I used Uber for the first time while in Italy. Tried two times to find my drivers. They had my hotel name. I was waiting outside for them. One driver never showed up. The other was late. Said he was waiting for  me down the street. I Cancelled. Uber then charges me 20 euros for two rides that never happened.  It took a \" act of congress\" to get a refund. They don't have customer service phone support. Just email and a self help system that has pre- chosen choices for you to pick regarding your problem. Then It directs you to a AI type system which is no help. Until this multi million dollar company decides to invest  in real phone support with a real C.S agent, I'll never use them.\n",
      "This is a review of what it is like to be a former contractor.First of all, I did apply to be a driver for Uber when I was driving for Lyft. However, my car and I got tired of driving people around and decided to go into another job. Anyway, I deleted my driver account from their app and delete it. Several years later when my license was about to expire. I get harassing emails from them to update their records to update my driver's license. I have already updated my driver's license but I am not going back to their website to do that. Instead, I went to their website to unsubscribe from mailing list. The next day, I get another reminder. Again, use their useless unsubscribe link to get my email address from their email list. This went on for two weeks straight when the website claims that their removal of email process takes 10 business days. Well, my birthday come and went (the day my license expires) and guess what email I got from them? You guessed it: update your expired driver's license on their website. Forget that! I have blocked them from my email account so I will not hear from them again (cross your fingers on that).\n",
      "My ride was fine with Uber driver, l wanted to tip him, however site says my password wrong so I go to reset and use that password and it says the password already been used, by the way this just 2nd time I used Uber. Their verification to do anything is totally ridiculous. I've spent over 30 mins playing I'm not a robot over and over till I've so mad I given up! All I wanted to do is give a tip!\n",
      "I love Uber. However, its customer service can do better. Read my Story. I have a fear of driving. As a result, for the last four years, I have used Uber almost every day to go everywhere; work, events, etc. I even use uber when I travel abroad. As an uber-veteran, I have experienced the good, the bad and the ugly. Yesterday, I forgot my phone in an uber vehicle. When I realized this, I used my room mate's phone to try to log into my account and contact the driver. However, I had forgotten my password. I decided to request a new one. That is where the trouble started. To help you retrieve your password, Uber has a two-step verification; they send you a four-digit code to your phone. This, of course, is for our safety. The problem is \"how do you get the code if you don't have your phone?\" The answer is easy. \"Customer service.\" Right? Only mine was not so easy. \n",
      "You can't check price before you book... I signed in, requested a price for the NEXT DAY (airport to hotel) and they charged me $5 for no show.\n",
      "I tried Uber for the first time when I flew to Miami on Tuesday, June 26. I'm not familiar with Miami airport so I just followed the exit/ground transportation signs to get outside. Once outside and not being sure how to use Uber, I asked a stranger outside if he knew how to use Uber and he told me was requesting an Uber himself. When he was done he helped me request an Uber, and showed me how to follow the driver on the app. While I'm waiting, I see at least 12 to 15 other people being picked up by Uber and/or Lyft.\n",
      "I have been taking Lyft for couple of days now and their application is totally accurate with the fare. I took Uber today, the same service UberX and their application says $18 (same amount as Lyft) and took it because I know I have a $5 discount from my recommendation (and I am regretting it now) but when I received the receipt, It says that my fare is $23, and deducted my $5.00 discount and a total of $18... This is probably the reason why they don't have Customer Service contact number!!!\n",
      "My wife and I took a train to NYC and when we got to the street a driver asked if we needed a Taxi which we said yes. When we got to his car we saw it was a SUV. I asked if he was an UBER driver and he said yes. I asked him to take us to the cruise ship terminal which was approx. 2 miles away. When we arrived he said that it would be $60.00 Yes $60.00. We were very disappointed because he did not give us a price to our destination. When the cruise was over we ended up taking a TAXI back to Penn center which we were charged $10.00. This was a bad experience for us and NYC should have better control of UBER drivers. I thought they were supposed to be in line with the Taxis. UBER just got their first and last trip from us.\n",
      "They did it twice. They overcharge. Last month some driver charged me 390 when it was showing 298. He said in mine it showing this,  when asked to show he said you check it again. But since my sister had booked it and I did not have the phone agreed and paid. I did not all her for somepersonal reason. But last night I was a fool I did not call my sister to confirm. The driver named swapnil picked me up from matunga at 9.45 and dropped me at powai. His car was from panvel. He was going to go without a passenger once I get down. The bill shown was 317 and he charged me 450. I gave him since I was in a hurry, instead I should have called my sister and confirmed. But is this ethically right? If I want to spend much money no matter how small or big the amount is I will do it all my will. I do not want such thugs around. Everytime overcharging. _x000D_Regards_x000D_Dhanada\n",
      "They use to be decent but I've found that the drivers are ignorant and racist in certain areas. Uber has no control of the drivers so the quality sucks. I had a driver nodding at the light (obviously high)...I got out of his car, he complained to Uber on me and they suspended my account...lol. They didn't investigate that the driver was a junkie. USE LYFT OR JUNO IF YOU'RE IN NEW YORK! They're cheaper, pay their drivers better and give much better service.\n",
      "My Uber arrived on time, car was clean though it reeked of cologne and had an overwhelming smell of either a car or a dog. I get in the car and get about a mile up the road and the Uber driver is heading in the direction of the neighboring county, though I'm in the next county in the complete opposite direction. I told him to turn around and go down a road heading in the correct direction to my home, but he blurted out, annoyed stating \"that road is shut down, and I can drop you off here and you can wait on the next Uber\". I stated that I was not getting out, and â€œI don't care which way you takeâ€, it just better be $24.14 like Uber stated on their website, which I screenshotted. \n",
      "Take Uber services at your own risk! Drivers may hoodwink you into paying more or cash for a non-cash trip! Uber help will wash their hands off and refuse to even contact the driver to sort out the issue! U Bet and End up Risky! I took a trip which had a Rs.75/- coupon applied. At the end of the trip Uber displayed Rs.279.82/- The driver asked me to pay what is displayed on the screen because he is unable to see it on his screen. I paid him 280/- and left the car. When I checked the Uber receipt, I found the trip cost to be only Rs.204.82/- I contacted the driver who offered to return the money; but later retracted. Uber also said they are unable to help. Uber displays two rates for a single trip; one higher and the other lower but displayed only in the receipt section. You will first notice the higher amount and pay!!! A system designed to allow drivers to take more money.\n",
      "I set up an Uber account. Great! (or so I thought) I used the service frequently, always maintained a score of 5.0 clearly displayed on my account beside my picture in my profile. I had to factory reset my phone, could not get my account back. Tried to re-register and was told my phone number was already in use. Received an email after finding some random way to complain through their app and was told the agent had to enter my account and set my phone number. Fine, no problem. Started off with a new account and went to add my picture and could not. I emailed back the same agent at which point he referred to me as a driver. I used Uber 4 times and just had a random email sent to me from Uber showing my score suddenly at a 4.87. How, I have no idea. I tipped, was friendly, showed up on time, gave 5 stars. My account still does not let me add my picture and does not show my score. \n",
      "My friend spent her 21st birthday clubbing and by the end of the night she was puking. Our Uber driver came to pick us up knowing we had a night of partying and a sick friend. On our drive home he stopped to let her puke. However she did puke on the outside and made a small mess in the car. After our trip I cleaned up everything inside it car as quick as I could. Then a week later we were charged with $150 for cleaning along with the charge of the trip for a very very minimal amount of puke on the seat belt and the outside of the car. We gladly would have paid 50 dollars for clean up however no matter what way we spun it definitely didnt cost 150 dollars to clean a car. He knew when he responded to our Uber need that we would be drunk. If he didnt want drunk people he did not need to respond. We will be sticking with lyft from now on.\n",
      "Uber needs to be shut down. They treat the drivers unfairly also the riders. I'm always being short paid instead they increase the service fee. How is it that they get paid more than me on a trip. That doesn't make sense. Drivers need to come together and report them or even boycott for a while until they fix the issues we are having and stop cheating us. If nothing changes then they Uber need to be ban from Atlanta.\n",
      "Don't use UBER!!! They are spamming me and stealing personal information they do not have permission to and worse... wont do anything about it. I can't imagine what info they are taking from those who have their app or actually signed up with them!\n",
      "So generally, I prefer Lyft over Uber mainly because over time it became apparent to me that Lyft has a better attitude towards its customers than Uber. And my suspicion was confirmed a few months ago when the story broke about sexual harassment claims at Uber and how they were handled. Until now though, I had never really experienced first-hand the callous nature of Uber's leadership. Here is my story:\n",
      "Got an Uber me and my friends on 6/9/18 at 3:03 am -3:30am. I was seated on the front passenger seat while playing music from my phone via the car's aux cable. When we got dropped I got out to help my friend who was seated at the back seat to get into the building. Before entering the building I realized that had left my phone in the Uber. After getting inside the building I attempt to call the Uber driver but he ignored all my calls. The phone rung but he never picked up. I called the driver multiple times and left him several voice mails to call me back. But he never called back. I went ahead and contacted Uber customer service and they informed me they've notified the driver about my phone. However, the driver stated he did not see any phone. But after tracking my phone it showed the device was in the Uber and got turned off 10 mins after he had dropped us... Such drivers are giving Uber a bad reputation.\n",
      "Uber is a big fraud . I live in Qatar and visited US where I booked uber  on 31st May . I got update on 13 June that I have been charged 150 dollars for cleaning. I was with my colleague and it was only 4 minutes trip and no mess has happened They are big fraud . Big time fraud\n",
      "I was delivering for a client when she had forgotten to put her hotel room number down, I gladly advised her that she would have to come downstairs to pick up her food, at which case she did, however the very next day, I was told my account would be placed on hold for 24hrs because she suspected my car to smell like weed. I advised Uber I would take a drug test and do anything needed to suffice the allegation, however Uber decided upon themselves to shut down my driving status for not 24 but 48hrs instead... Uber lies, and so does the customer's supposed allegation that can't be proven... There should be protocol for things of that nature, however there aren't. This matter could have been dealt a little better, and cleared up and resolved, however I did not get that kind of approach from their hubs, nor their support system. Uber has a bad track record for unresolved issues, in my opinion, and that's the way they like it...\n",
      "Yesterday, I took an Uber from Union, NJ to Staten Island,NY ($45 ride). The Uber driver allegedly spilled some rice, took a picture and then nailed my credit card for a $145 cleaning fee. The ride took place in the midnight and I do not eat in the car. Uber said sorry. This is a fraudulent, UBER and its drivers are dishonest. I will never use UBER again.\n",
      "Beware anyone who rides with UBER. They are dealing in FRAUDULENT practices!!! For 3 weeks now I was offered the Ride to Earn Savings... 9 rides for a certain percentage of ride the following week. Each week I have taken 10 or more rides. In one day I took 6 Ubers but got credit for only one!!! This week, although I earned the ride savings and have 20 rides that are supposed to be discounted UBER still REFUSES to apply THEIR PROMOTION!!! They keep responding with, \"Sorry while we look into this response.\" ALL the while I cannot use my promotion. \n",
      "Yesterday, I took an Uber from the airport (43 dollar ride). The uber driver allegedly poured a liquid on the seat, took a picture and then nailed my credit card for a 150 dollar cleaning fee. The ride took place in the morning and I do not drink. Uber said sorry. I apparently am not the only one that has experienced this Uber money making plan. The reviews say (take a video of the inside of the car, in case you have another alleged dishonest Uber driver). In the future, I will take a taxi.\n",
      "Not only was my driver unable to find me, we had to wait on the avenue rather than in front of the building where we were staying. On our trip home the driver went a roundabout way and that extended the trip by 8 miles plus the extra charge for the time. The original fare quote was changed. I understand charging for tolls but I don't want to contribute to some drivers fund that's tacked on at the bottom of the receipt. We are going back to car service where the fees are set. No surprises. No more $121. one way trips to NYC.\n",
      "On 6/7/2018 I used my Uber gift card to try to book a ride. As I was booking my ride it depleted my gift card of $45. I was left with $4.71 in my account. And then it asked me to confirm: I did and it said \"oops something went wrong. You don't have enough credits. Use another payment method.\" I have been trying to get my $45 returned to me and they won't respond to my emails. NOTE: this was my 2nd time trying to use Uber and it completely failed. Not only did I not receive their services. They CHARGED ME and won't return any emails. I was LATE for work!\n",
      "Uber to and From McCarren International Las Vegas - The driver sat in front of the wrong house and I had to go retrieve him. I was charged a waiting fee!! On my return home from a trip using UBER. The fare was much greater, the driver took about 20 minutes to arrive and then drove a bizarre route taking an extra 15 minutes!! They say the fee was the same however the fee was based on the distance from the airport to my home. I will not use UBER again.\n",
      "Friday -- June 8th, 2018 -- Uber SUCKS  Big Time  !!! This has happened last year also. Today, early morning, I loaded another $50.00 on my Uber Account (but the app did not even show the two cards I loaded, or my previous balance, which was almost $100.00), around 7:00 a.m.. Around noon I tried to get an Uber Ride, but the Uber app would NOT acknowledge me !!! The app kept asking me if I wanted to open an Uber Account, but I already have one, and I know my log-in perfectly.There is NO Customer Service phone number or E-mail Address !!! WTF  kind of Customer Service is that  !!! Uber >>> YOU SUCK Big Time  !!! I wanted to use up my Uber Credit, but I cannot depend on Uber to even get a ride !!!! Late for work, late for doctors appointments  !!! >>> Lyft will continue to be my BEST ride service  !!! Uber gets a Big FAT >>> Zero Rating . Get your act together Uber >>> You SUCK  !!!Last year the same thing happened when I tried to get a ride, but Uber app did NOT even acknowledge me  !!! I had over $150.00 (US) on my Uber account, but could not get a ride. Error message said something was wrong with my bank account, but there was nothing wrong with my bank account !!!>>> Uber Sucks Big Time  !!! The absolute WORST Customer Service in my life (and I've seen some pretty bad customer service) .. They have NO Customer Service  !!! Can't get any worse than that, can you !!!\n",
      "Friday - June 8th, 2018 - Uber SUCKSâ€¦ Big Tim!!! This has happened last year also.

      "I took Uber in France Nice yesterday twice and they charged my credit card six times. I am in shock. As I am on holidays I can't cancel my card. Needless to say I won't be using them again. I don't know what they are trying to get away with but suffice to say I shall get the charges reversed and never use them again. What is the world coming to whereby this is a common business practice? Do yourself a favor... don't use Uber. Lots of other choices.\n",
      "My first time using Uber for transportation went very badly. I was all set to be picked up and received a message to get ready for pick up. So, I go out and wait in the drive for my pickup. But no one ever came... So I went back to check my trip information and it was all erased as if it had never been scheduled. It is so wrong to treat people like this.\n",
      "A friend of mine was drinking to much and needed a ride. I tried to use uber to pick her up . The app no longer allows you to change the pick up point . It was horrible my friend ended up walking drunk on a dark country road for over a mile before I could pick her up .They have no clue as to why people need taxi service . and are so user unfriendly . I downloaded Lyft at least they have a clue\n",
      "This service is highly dependent on the time of day and who you get as a driver.  Prices fluctuate tremendously so be careful.  If prices are high, wait a few minutes and they might be lower.  Ya just never know.  I would say mostly better than a cab tho.\n",
      "The driver never showed up even though he messaged me he would be here in 25 min. I had to search the site and hours later it said driver cancelled. They are a joke of a business.\n",
      "I took Uber twice this weekend and both times the driver cancelled the trips before they got to me. When I asked for a refund they said it would be coming in 3-5 business days, yet it's been a week and I still have not received my money back. I'm out $30 because of this company and their terrible customer service. Just use Lyft for a way better experience.\n",
      "I FEEL DEFRAUDED BY UBER! Today, I did Uber express for $2.78. The map to walk to the pickup point was COVERED IN UBER NOTICES plus what little of the map I could see lacked any street names next to me, nor did uber provide directions on where to walk, nor were the dots accurate (perhaps it wanted me to use the backdoor because those dots sure didn't make sense walking out the front door) and Uber did NOT provide an exact physical address for me to google. Worst, is uber provides NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM and now uber charges me a $5 cancellation fee for a $2.78 ride? Seriously - this IS fraudulent! I'm reporting this to the DC & Florida attorney general's and I will NOT use uber again until this is resolved in person by a real live uber person. Get a clue uber - This does not work but I will to make sure you do not do this to others or me again!\n",
      "Check your bill, if you take different trips write it down and what they charge you. We used it to go to work and home. Price should have been the same every day. Monthly bill came and there were several off prices about 6 we found. You call, give them info and 3-4 days later they call and say, \"ok, we can deduct it or give you a credit for further rides.\" Myself, I would have liked to know how they got so screwed up but they offered no explanation for that. A few drivers don't speak English but our drive was easy. Good company. Just ALWAYS CHECKS your bills end of month.\n",
      "This idiot not only came to pick us up but kept forgiving by, cancelled the pick up on his end where we were not only charged cancellation fee but also the $45 for the trip. Can't get anyone live on the phone!!! By the way... it was our honeymoon!!!\n",
      "I'm sitting at home watching TV and get two quick messages from my PayPal account saying I used PayPal to pay for two Uber rides one for $100 and one for $68. This was followed by a text from Uber saying I changed my sign in information and password. I immediately changed my PayPal password and tried to log into my Uber account. Of course I couldn't because of the fraud. I am not able to get in touch with Uber because the phone number I have goes to a fax machine and I can't get a better number. I can't text them because I can't sign into my account. Any suggestions on what to do??? I cannot fight through PayPal because PayPal said I authorized Uber to use my PayPal account and they can't put a hold on the money. Again, any solutions are appreciated!\n",
      "Uber was charge my credit card for a ride that I never booked. I was sitting in home and a Uber driver called somewhere in MN saying that he is waiting for me. So surprise and I told him that I never want any ride, he hung up and I received an email that Uber charge me for cancel the service. That is a setup somewhere to steal my money. I got credit to my next ride, but not to my credit card. Shame on you, Uber.\n",
      "I live in a rural area. Lyft does not serve this area at all and Uber requires up to 1 hour wait to get an Uber car to me. When traveling 15 miles or less a taxi is not only more convenient, quicker but only $2 or $3 more than Uber or Lyft.\n",
      "Yesterday Uber had charged me $43.70 for 20 minutes 8.1 miles long drive that we were making two times a week for the past 2 years and usually costed us $18-21. I have contacted Uber and they claim that the charge is justified because it happened during alleged peak hours and after back and forth correspondence offered to credit me back 25% of that charge, which is still way too high. Let us run the numbers. Effectively, what Uber is trying to say by defending this charge of $43.70 for 20 minute 8.1 miles long ride is that your driver is making $131.10/hour that would translate into $272,480 annual salary!!! Really? An executive salary for the taxi drivers and you are expecting the general public to believe this nonsense!?! Which percent of this revenue the driver is actually going to see?\n",
      "I usually purchase a Uber Gift Card to run weekly errands as Uber. The reason why I use that method was because every time I used my bank card Uber puts a ridiculous hold on my card causing my bank account to be overdrawn. To combat that issue I started purchasing the Uber Gift Card. This past weekend, I was preparing to go grocery shopping and tried requesting for an Uber using my gift card credit. This was a short trip literally 4 blocks at that. I received a message saying try a new payment method, so I said I will add another Uber gift card. That didn't work, so I called a local cab to pick up me up and take me to the store. I thought it may have been an issue with the application, so I went on shopping. I had already placed money on the gift card and wanted to use it to get back home. Another message advising me I must add a new payment method. \n",
      "Be careful when using Uber. My daughter injured her foot/ankle and had ice on it during her ride. She left behind water on the floor and was charged a $150 \"clean-up fee\" two days later for a $5 trip. The driver did not mention that she \"damaged\" his car and had to charge her an add'l $150. And, the only way to reach Uber is through email. Just sad that Uber drivers can rip people off so easily. I suggest you take pictures of the interior car before and after ride.\n",
      "I have used Uber often to get to airport. I used it today to get home, and noticed price they quoted was high. Double. I booked it 'cause after checking all Uber options. I asked driver why so high and he said should be normal and that's all he was getting from Uber. Emailed them numerous times and didn't give me a reason why they estimated so high and refused to change charge. I keep email them and have stopped responding to me. I will keep going.\n",
      "My first time ordering was GREAT! Ordered from McDonald's. With normal traffic it takes 7-9 mins from my place. First time food was mediocre warm but I do expected that. Driver was great, friendly and for price I thought, \"Yep. I'll be using this, though I wish they had more food choices for our area.\" Placed order on 3/22 at 2:46 pm. Food delivered 3:20 and as I said mediocre warm (as I expected so no biggy). My latest order on 5/28/18 I placed order same restaurant at 9:01 pm food was delivered at 9:27 pm so 26 mins later versus the 32 mins from 1st order and the food was cold as if it came out of fridge. \n",
      "I began using Uber in February 2018 for travel from home to Philadelphia airport. The price for the first trip was $43.39. I just tried to schedule a pickup for Tuesday morning at 545 am the time I usually travel and the Uber X (which I always take) is $82.00. This price has continually gone up over 4 months. Uber is no longer a viable option for me.\n",
      "My wife decided to start driving for Uber and Lyft this summer as a means of earning a small amount of additional income. Sadly she's been made to realize this was a major mistake. At least on the Uber side of things. We live in Tucson, Arizona, and on the Uber site it states that our city has no fee associated with vehicle inspection. However, after signing up and getting all her ducks in a row she came to find that her account had a negative -$20 balance. She has since called five times and been told each time that she will be credited within 24 to 72 hours. She's even gotten emails indicating this will occur. Yet here we are two weeks later and nothing has happened. \n",
      "I used Uber two years ago in Philly multiple times and never had a problem. Had no need to use them again until the third week in May 2018. Logged into the app and scheduled a ride. Everything went well and the driver arrived as expected. I took my ride, tipped the driver in cash (who was very nice and polite) and thought that was the end of it. When I got my emailed receipt, the ride was $10 more than it should have been! I contacted Uber through email to resolve and they claimed that I chose the \"Uber XL\" trip, which was more $$ (I have to assume because my driver came in a newer Cadillac Escalade?), but I ABSOLUTELY did NOT choose that ride option when I booked it. I remember seeing it as an option, but that's not what I wanted nor chose. \n",
      "I had Uber drive me about one mile distance to pick up my car from repairs. It wasn't the first time I rode Uber but this time I was told to take the rear seat against my protests. C'mon now, I'm just a little old lady. Would do no harm sitting in front. I was unable to fasten my seatbelt as it just won't go it. Meanwhile the car was already moving so I had no choice. I guess the driver didn't care about their passenger's safety. Next time will try Lyft. I have no order number on hand as this ride was arranged by the auto repair shop. I don't own a smartphone. The ride took place on May 25 in the afternoon.\n",
      "I recently took an Uber ride and something seemed very \"off\" about the the driver so I wrote down his name and searched online for him and found his FB page on which he posted numerous videos discussing how  he and his girlfriend are homeless and living in  their beat up 10+ yr old  car ,which is the one he uses to Uber,which is sad and indicates that driving for Uber is not a great career, but he also discussed   that he takes numerous anti psychotic  medications.as well as that there is a protective order against him.! I do not  think  this person should be driving the public around and Uber should do a much better job of choosing who they hire to do so.I would not feel safe using their service again.\n",
      "Me and my wife and our son recently visited Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. While we got an Uber to a popular night spot approximately 15 min from our hotel. I thought the price was a little high going there, $30.00, but to my amazement, that was just their advertised price, to get back from the same spot, the price jumped to $65.00, more than double for the same distance. That's why we started using Uber several years ago to get away from the price gouging cab drivers, but now looks like Uber is the ones we need to be leery of. I will not be using Uber again. Try Lyft, same ride for $20.00. Shame on you Uber.\n",
      "My daughters Prom was Saturday May 19th, I scheduled a Uber Black SUV a week before the Prom to pick up her and her date.  At the very last minute we received a message saying there were no SUV's available.  We tried for almost an hour to reach someone to get a vehicle.  This ruined my daughters Prom, we had to ask a neighbor if they would mind taking them to the Prom.  I find this to be so unprofessional.  They ended up getting to the Prom about 1 1/2 hour late, missed meeting up with some of their friends to take group pictures. Never once have we received an apology for ruining my daughters special night. I would think twice about scheduling an Uber for any occasion.\n",
      "I live in Jersey City New Jersey. Been taking Uber for about 2 years to work and from work in Hoboken. I thought the prices were really reasonable but the last month or two the prices are going through the roof even for pool. This is terrible when you do this to working people. Looks like I will be taking buses and trains again.\n",
      "This was our first time using Uber - My husband wanted a ride to and from Smart Financial Center for an event. We had difficulty getting the first attempt at making a future reservation to take and ended up with someone on the way on the wrong day. We cancelled that ride successfully and was billed $10 for the cancellation. The next day we successfully got the reservation set up for the pick up.\n",
      "Got an Uber for a 5 mile one way trip. Everything seemed fine, paid fare and gave $15 tip which I thought was generous given the extremely short ride. Received message the next day that driver reported that I left an item in her car and she returned it to me resulting in an additional $15 fee paid directly to driver. I left NOTHING in vehicle and she dropped NOTHING off to me. Googled and apparently these fraudulent fees for lost item returns and cleanings that never happened are common amongst Uber drivers to increase their income. Beware.\n",
      "While working for Uber, Uber gives you the option to do InstaPay so you can cash out up to 5 times a day, they boast, they also charge you $0.50 per transaction. I made two transactions on InstaPay the weekend of May 19/20. Although I never received my instapay transactions and was still charged the dollar for the transfers. Uber refuses to give my money back, stating that I accepted the fees! The problem with that statement is of course, that I never received what I paid fees for! If they do this to all of their drivers, I don't understand how they could ever have money problems!!! True scam artists & at least one very displeased Uber \"partner\". Not to mention that if you drive food for them that they send the driver to restaurants far from you so they make more money??? Very unprofessional Uber, Shame On You!\n",
      "I've been driving for Uber for a while. I believe Uber is faking its surges to charge more to customers during masked high demand times (customers pay more when demand is high during surges, however, per my experience there is considerably less demand or enough drivers showed up in the area that there is no reason to increase the rates during those surge times). I will make it simple. The following happened many time so I can tell that it was definitely not an error occasion, but a strategy to increase rates at surge times.\n",
      "Let me tell you first I'm a very nice and educated lady, and I'm driving a Uber for a month part time, while waiting for summer semester to start. I rarely complain and write bad reviews. But now I can't remain silent. Uber owners, you don't care of your drivers at all! You pay us $12 per hour (on average), it's a shame!! Because I will not drive anyone for $ 12, minus I using my car, so basically it's $9 per hour BEFORE taxes!! I did Pool Uber, I drove 1 hour 30 minutes nonstop, and guess what they paid me? $ 21! Minus gas, it's $ 16-18! And riders are very demanding, especially when they are in the POOL, and after all â€œturn here, stop there, give me water, air conditioning on a cold dayâ€œ they don't leave tips!!! \n",
      "Driver cancels then I get a cancellation charge?? Then I tried to find a number to call Uber... Goodluck with that! I reported it to my bank and I requested to have my account deleted, which was another major job! I REALLY DISLIKE THIS COMPANY... VERY SNEAKY AND SHADY!!\n",
      "Visiting Canada but drivers can't speak English so theres an immediate communication barrier which is not good in a foreign country.The driver never looked for me; 2 minutes are up.  I tried to cancel, then found him.  He didn't take me but was billed anyway.2 minutes is never enough time to identify a drivver.  No signage on their cars.....terrible service.Beware.  Bad business model.  Take a taxi instead.\n",
      "How much you can make depends on where you drive.  If you drive in or near a big city like Philadelphia you can probably make a decent income.  But it you live and drive in Delaware you can expect less than $80 a week.  As a Uber driver I have waited whole days for a passenger pickup and NOTHING!!\n",
      "On vacation in Hollywood, Fl a month ago and needed a ride to Miami Cruise Port. DoubleTree Hotel recommended an Uber ride to Port. Signed up, created account, and driver arrived across street. No worries, we pulled our luggage to her. She was a young Spanish girl, barely spoke English, beautiful new car. Off she went on interstate, barreling along UNTIL traffic called to a screeching halt. She slammed brakes, skidded into left lane and with horns honking, barely missed getting hit from every direction. She shook her hands upset and started up again with traffic.\n",
      "My Uber failed to show up, did not answer my phone call, and proceeded to cancel my trip. Uber then charged me a fee, with no opportunity to explain, comment, etc. I canceled my Uber account. I took a taxi. Taxi was immediately available and was no more expensive than Uber. Upon return home, I tried to reach Uber to remedy the situation. They take your money and then are virtually unreachable. I GIVE UBER ZERO STARS!\n",
      "I ordered an Uber in Albany NY this morning. I selected Albany Airport as my destination. The driver arrived on time in a car that seemed dingy and small but it was supposed to be a short ride so no problem. Except that it turned out not to be a short ride at all. To reach the airport, he needed to take a right out of the parking lot and then another left at the major intersection. It's knew that it was that simple to find and I had only been in the city 3 days. He took a left out of the parking lot and I questioned him as I knew that was wrong. \n",
      "Ordering a future UBER ride and it scheduled the ride for immediately. While trying to contact driver, got message that said to leave a message. He was in front of the house before I could cancel, so I was billed $5.00 for a cancelled ride. The UBER company APP is lousy when it comes to scheduling advance rides, furthermore, when the driver arrives before you can cancel, you are still billed for the call. When trying to contact UBER directly, you cannot do it. No number exists for the city in which you are scheduling the ride and no number exists for a one to one contact to explain your situation. The only number is a help option but it does not work for complaints, only for emergencies. Not going to use Uber in the future.\n",
      "Poor service and a rip-off! Yesterday I requested Uber ride service at 8:34am. At 8:37am they confirmed the request and advised the car and driver and pick up location, which was a street corner 5 minutes walk from my home, which I thought was odd for not picking me up at my home. My wife and I stood there in the direct sun waiting... then the Uber App sent me notice saying it would be another 4 minutes wait... then another notice saying it would be another 5 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 13 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 19 minutes. \n",
      "I was taken to a location that I did not request, nor had I ever heard of. The driver was very rude. Uber would not refund my money. On two prior occasions they charged me two times for one ride. I was refunded, but it was a major inconvenience.\n",
      "I've been using Uber for a couple of years now, and I've got to say I'm disappointed with their customer service. I had a pool driver who never came, and as a result, I had to order a different more expensive Uber driver (at 3x the price) to get to my location on time, like I would have had the driver come on time or I had taken the train. I contacted customer service (which is a hassle in itself) and asked to be refunded the difference but was told that they â€œappreciated the feedbackâ€ but that I should have tried to use a pool or something if I was uncomfortable with the price. I'm now using Lyft because I don't have these sorts of problems.\n",
      "As a driver I thought Uber was  a great company ,until I was in an accident. That is when you will find out what a lousy company they really are.Because you are  using you own vehicle they suspended my account did absolutely nothing to help me get back on the road or assist me in getting a rental car. Uber non customer service is a real joke they where a useless piece of garbage.They have a 1000 dollar deductibe you have to pay to speed up the process and they tell  you the will go after the other carries insurance company.It will be 20 days before my car is fixed.\n",
      "26 April, 2018, Maryland, USA. I ordered an Uber to Dulles airport. There was no incident during the trip that resulted to a damage or spillage... No vomiting, no eating, no drinking. Beverages. I drank bottled water only. When we were dropped off at the airport, the driver did not complain of any damages neither were they any damage to his car's interior and exterior. He even dusted his entire car in our presence before taking off while we loaded our luggages in the cart. However, 12 days after the trip, Uber deducted and extra $80 from my account as cleaning fee. After writing to them and demanding clarity, I was sent a picture of a huge mess on one of the car seats. If my mom or older sister or myself made such a mess, it could not have been hidden. I am so shocked by the picture and its source. A vomit of this nature cannot go unnoticed.\n",
      "Saturday, May 5th late morning, I used Uber for a 20 minute drive from my home to a high school where my chorus was performing a concert. I have used Uber a number of times in the past with positive results. I carried only a light suit bag with me. No food or drinks. I agreed to the $17 fare and was delivered without any delays. Later in the day, my email showed a double charge...two $17 charges at exactly the same time...an honest error, I thought. The next morning they emailed to notify they were correcting my charge to add an $80 cleaning fee! I am disputing this, but the truth is the driver was creating extra charges. I didn't spill or do anything to his vehicle, nor did he advise me of adding a cleaning fee. He complained endlessly during the trip of his late car payment. I won't use Uber again since this is a nearly impossible dispute. They apparently accept the drivers word with no proof.\n",
      "HUGE WARNING TO UBER USERS!!! I will never use UBER again - every time I tried to add my home address, it would find it on the map and then when I would try and add it to my favorites, it kept adding a different address with the same street name in Toronto. I live north of Ottawa 4.5 hours away!!!!!!!! but that wasn't clear from their app because on the list of favorites it only shows the street name and not the town. When I first got in the Uber car, the guy went WOW , you want a drive from here to Toronto... that's 4.5 hrs. He had to manually enter the address in his system. then when I selected a 15% tip at the end of the trip, it calculated it on a fair for the original 4.5 hour trip. the $62 flashed by and I said wait a minute..It can't be that much?? He should me that the fair was $14 on his system and Uber only adds 20% so it will be less than $20. I said are you sure? He said yes. I felt dumb because it was only the second time I had used Uber so got out. After he left, I double checked my phone and saw that yes the fair was $20 but a tip of $62 was added even though I chose the 15% tip option. It must have calculated it on the original 4.5 hour fair. Now they will only give me a credit on my Uber account and NOT a refund on my card. On top of that his car was old and rattled although he was nice enough. the whole experience was bad. BEWARE!!!\n",
      "If you're planning to use Uber, beware of extra added fees and know that the app is not easily understandable. You can only book a ride using their app. It does not allow you to review your ride before purchasing it. You are booking a ride unaware that you have booked it. A car shows up, you get charged and if you're not there, you get charged a $5.00 cancellation fee. Drivers are supposed to call or text you when they arrive, but some don't. They drive off because you can't find them and you get charged for the ride and another late fee. There are no human beings available to talk to when you have problems. You have to manoeuvre around in their app to send an email to customer service. This company is a money making rip off. I would not recommend using it, especially if you're not familiar with apps.\n",
      "I am a driver on the Uber platform and have driven in Chicago, Illinois. Recently had my account put on hold due to a \"report of possible impairment while driving\". This is total B.S.

I receive all types of race and gender related ignorance and biases and I am vulnerable at all times unless I protect myself while I am on the road. Uber allows passengers to make false reports that affect the driver, but has no way for the driver to protect themselves from the false attacks.

      "I've only recently started using Uber for rides to and from work or to the next city over to visit close friends being that I do not have a car anymore. I've noticed inconsistencies in the fares as well as being blamed for the mistakes that drivers are making or that the â€œUber GPSâ€ makes. I was charged over $40 from my house to the house of a friend 10 miles away and the same ride was the same distance where I was taken 10 miles home. The ride home only cost me $21. How the HELL did it climb an extra $20? Especially when my driver got lost and passed my drop-off route. I sent a complaint hoping to get a price adjustment and was told that I basically should have told my driver not to get lost. As if it was my fault that they continued to pass my drop off point which was clearly made known before my pick up in the first place. Goodbye Uber and hello Lyft.\n",
      "I requested a car to pick me up which is always a $20.00 fare. This morning was no different. It displayed $11.00 for a carpool or $20.00 for a single fare. I accepted.

      "Previously, I loved Uber. I am a long haul driver and can park my tractor trailer somewhere and Uber to get food or sightsee. Here is my horror story. I'm telling it because if you use Uber, you might also want to have a Lyft account on standby. I went to IKEA in Cincinnati. After shopping, I logged in to get a ride back to my tractor 4 miles away. My payment was denied. What had happened, according to Citibank, Uber hit my card 10 times for a zero dollar amount, therefore shutting it down due to fraudulent activity. Finally, as my phone was running out of battery life, and it was getting darker and colder outside, I was able to choose a method they did take. This can happen, and the Citibank rep informed me that Uber does this a lot. Lyft not so much. If you use Uber have alternate transportation set up. If you are sightseeing know how to get back to where you need to go. Uber WILL leave you stranded.\n",
      "Ubereats - My older daughter ordered food from this service, and as far as I can gather the driver, from the street, spotted her younger sister (16) on the front stoop. Not sure if he thinks he's a junior g-man or what, but he called the police and reported a child endangerment issue for her strawberry hemangioma. In case you don't know, that's a birthmark. It's not even that pronounced, and he was in his car. After a visit from the police, who seemed puzzled by the non-issue and reported everything ok - I guess it turns out not to be a police issue to have a birthmark. So, I decide to complain to the company. Guess what - NO CONTACT NUMBERS OR EMAILS available - at all. Make of that what you will. They are not welcome at my house anymore.\n",
      "I started driving Uber when they opened the in Tampa, Florida market. I was issued an iPhone to utilize for driver tools. I drove a few times but quit since I was not getting the business Uber had advertised. Anyway, I received notification that they were going to charge fees for using it or I could use my smartphone for no fee. I returned the iPhone and did not drive for about 2 years.\n",
      "I starting using again recently. I noticed my personal checking account balance was getting lower. I checked my statement online and Uber had been charging my personal bank card, and not my preferred business card which is my selected card. My personal card was only to used if my business account had low funds which was not the case. Uber insisted for 2 weeks that if I gave them the dates and times of the rides, they would reverse those payments, and charge the correct card. They did not do that, and then started asking to provide all of that information again and I had already done that 4 times.\n",
      "We used Uber for the first time in Panama City Beach last weekend. All three drivers were wonderful. We had a blast. The first driver was so sweet and smart, his daughter called him while we were driving and he would not even talk to her because he was on the job, second guy was sweet and country and professional, third was a female, very sweet and took us right to our motel. We will be using them on our next trip. I don't get the bad reviews but I was in Florida so people may be nicer there. Thank you Uber.\n",

UBER charged me for that services I never used, I tried to contact them but no one returned my money back for that services I never used but they charged until i contacted to my credit card. I really disappointed and i would never use UBER again. I would suggest people to think twice if they need such a service.\n",

If you don't wanna be insulted don't drive for Uber. I'll never drive Uber again and I deleted my driver and rider apps.

      "Having flown overnight 4 hrs took Uber this morning 7.15 am from Chatrapati Shivaji terminal T2 Mumbai airport. Car number ** driver name Ram. I paid him and whilst getting down forgot my mobile left back seat. In 15 mins called my number and the driver picked up saying he has picked another passenger and is near bus terminal Mulund. I asked him if he can wait and I come by rickshaw and pick my mobile. He agreed. Bus terminal is just 10 mins from my house. I rushed, however, he was not there. Upon calling he mentioned the passenger was getting late and could not wait. I asked him how will he return my phone he asked me to call back. On calling he mentioned that I need to pay 20 rupees per kilometer to come and deliver the phone accepted. Tried calling him the full day. Finally he said shall come in the evening. Called him evening. He said, \"Have left. Please pay me. Am coming.\" Accepted. Waiting. Still not arrived. \n",
      "My 15 year old son ordered an Uber. The driver got on our street and never stopped. He had canceled the ride, we finally was able to message Uber and they credited $5 back to his account which isn't supposed to post until 1:00 a.m. On top of that the ride was $7.10 so they cheated a child out of $2.10. Bad company to use. So I had to call Lyft. They came through.\n",
      "I was charged an extra 17 dollars separate toll to go from Staten Island to Brooklyn. There IS no toll in that direction. Uber is not refunding the charge and just sent me out a pre written BS response that had nothing to do with my issue. This company is dishonest. I'm using Lyft now.\n",
      "I booked a cab. Why would the rider be 15 to 20 mins away and still take the pick up. And later I was not able to contact the driver Senthil **. Number was not valid it said. Whatever then even after waiting for long... It was still that far away... It was no use. Later I had to cancel the ride as it was just not approaching on the map towards me. It was going ahead. Later after canceling the ride why should I bear the cost. Is it always our mistake?\n",
      "Uber takes the WORST routes! They will take you in circles, then bring you back to your starting point to pick up another rider to make $2. LYFT is no better! Cant wait for more competitors to join the market. Maybe then theyll take their customers best interests into consideration.\n",
      "I took Uber this morning to work and lost my cell phone in the driver's car. I have my passwords on my phone and I don't know my Uber app password. I can't reset my password because there is 2-step verification and I don't have my cell phone to receive the text message code. I have left 4 separate requests for help through the Uber website and I have heard nothing from them, after almost 3 hours. There is apparently no published Uber phone number that I can call. I am beyond frustrated. I will never use Uber again; my family will never use Uber again; I am going to tell anyone and everyone about my extremely negative experience in the hopes that they will never use Uber again. I will join the #deleteUber campaign. I will testify in Congress if I get the chance. This is just ridiculous.\n",
      "I was 2 years with Uber. After some however they deactivated me permanently through a system generated multiple messages by itself. Bleach was hitting me hard. Multiple times underpaid. I was not impressed. They are not a nice company and they decided to deactivated me. To get my money over 20000 dollars underpaid 85% was promised. But turned out 50% only and fee for me and the rider pick up fee. I think Uber was good when they was paying the driver right but knowing that are going to be criminal stuff from creating a hassle working and freaking out situation from support in live. This people are awesome in threatening the people bad and take their money.\n",
      "On April 16th, I purchased a $10 Uber gift card to add to my credits to ensure I had enough credits to go to store and back home. This brought my credit balance to 13.50, one way ride was $6, therefore, I would have the $12 total to cover there and back, well I thought. On attempt to confirm ride home I had no credits remaining, even after the first ride receipt only showed $6. This left me stranded and having to walk 4 miles home because I had no more payment options. Contacted Uber via email when made it home. They gave me some dumb excuse about an authorization hold on an additional $6 to ensure there was enough on payment method to cover trip. Well first of all, this policy relates to debit or credit card use, and secondly, I've ride many times using gift cards and this never happened. Well they continued to reply saying the hold was released and I should contact my bank. HILARIOUS... what bank... idiots, I used YOUR UBER gift card. \n",
      "I usually take regular Uber. On April 15th I was traveling from Evanston to Hyatt at McCormick center and I called Uber pool since I had more time. The charges they showed were $16.32 and I accepted it. However they charged me $27.93. When I contacted Uber support, they continued to give me boilerplate answers. This is extremely frustrating. I explained to them that I had put the right address and was dropped off at right place, but they refused. The driver's name was Yvonne, and the Uber support is from someone named KOUSHIK from India (judging from the time posted, it say April 17th, and it's still April 16th in USA). This stupid jerk kept on telling me that I had different drop off than what was requested. I took back the Uber from same place, so check it jerk. To make my experience worse, when I took the ride back, again with Uber, he dropped me off 2 blocks away and I had to walk in pouring rain. Never again.\n",
      "During a trip to NYC, I quickly found that Uber rides are more expensive than cab fare. I decided to try the ride share one evening when money was tight. When I ordered the ride, it gave a pick up time 10 to 15 minutes away. When I accepted, it immediately changed to 1 minute, and I had to run to catch the ride. The driver dropped me off at a corner in Times Square, in the pouring rain, telling me this was my destination. I realized that he had dropped me 4 blocks away. I wandered around Times Square, in the pouring rain, dressed for a reception. My shoes and purse were completely ruined, as was my evening. I am deleting the app. I will never use them again.\n",
      "On April 15th several of my friends were downtown at a concert and decided to take an Uber to and from the concert so none of us would drink and drive. Our first UberXL (1-6 people) was $53 for 21 miles. No problem. When it came time to leave later that evening we selected the same Uber except the upfront price shown was $54.82. That was fine. When we arrived at our drop off destination another simple 21 miles away our ending fare was $124.42... Confused I contacted Uber since this was our first time using the service and I was told that the fare was correct and they up the prices at night to encourage drivers to be there. I was told there was nothing they could do and was assured that the fare was correct. \n",
      "My account was hacked by someone in London who has been using it to bill rides for 5 days (starting 4/10). I cancelled/deleted my account via the App. The charges continued. I contacted Uber support via Twitter who told me to change my password - which I did. The charges continued. They have credited some of the charges but now the support team doesn't seem to be actually investigating my problem. I only receive \"boiler plate\" responses and no resolution. On 4/15 I deleted the account using the Web interface. I also deleted it again from my phone. I will contact my credit card company to deny payment for these rides.\n",
      "I don't understand why Uber expect you to pay the driver for a trip when they have taken you to the wrong place. Because the drive GPS pick the wrong locate. I think that a Driver should check the locate where you're going when you live in a Big city when there a lot of places that sound and spell the same. Very dissatisfied. Very dissatisfied. Very dissatisfied.\n",
      "I booked cab at 11 pm but the cab not at all moving towards my pickup location. I called driver so many times, but he was unable to pickup the call. Still I waited for 20 mins after I cancelled the ride. For this I need to bear cancellation fee. This is happened for so many times. My issue is not with fee and all. It's all about night time waiting for a ride after so many hours of journey.\n",
      "Wait time fee assessed being the following conditions are true. I ordered the Uber in the exact location I was standing when the Uber arrived. The Uber driver did NOT await on me one second as I was waiting in an obvious location that is easily visible from anywhere in the parking lot. According to the policy, although the driver didn't wait for me - I was the one who waited. â€œA fee will be begin a few minutes after your driver arrivesâ€ & â€œWe will notify you that a charge has startedâ€. Neither of these conditions occurred.\n",
      "I had ordered a Uber cab and when I ordered it the fee was around $6, however once I arrived at my destination I received a notice that they had charged me extra fees without my knowledge or permission. I contacted them about this through Twitter and somehow my complete order was changed to the larger car, which I did not order. I guess they don't know that people get notifications when another device logs into your account because I received a notification that someone in Orange County had logged into my Uber account.\n",
      "how about I took uber about 6x and got a vehicle and uber continue to charge my credit cards that was on file. They have no real contact information so I am filing a claim against them for my money I dont care if it only 16 dollars....I believe in fairness and honesty...so I am filing....they arent helping the customer but instead cheating the customer.....and yet would have so questions on their site stating pick one you were drop off at the wrong location or your driver was lost no and no you took my money in my account when I didnt use you at all. Thanks and you have a good day@#$%^%$\n",
      "Driver got lost , could not find us. He was dressed like a junkie, Made U turns, drove us unsafely in an old, dirty car. In the end we were overcharged. _x000D_Next time we were in Chicago, we just booked through a local limo company with great service and reasonable prices\n",
      "When I first started riding with Uber a year ago the price was OK and when they were \"surging\" it was usually early morning, holidays and late night. Now it seems like the surging is constant. Price is one thing and another minute later it's ten dollars or more higher and it's not even a holiday or early morning or weather conditions. Drivers are charging fees for things that haven't happened, like spills, cleaning fees, burnt cigarettes. I don't smoke, but I learned early on always take pictures before and after your trips 'cause drivers will try to get you. They aren't ending trips on time, they're canceling without even getting close to the pickup spot. This company is out of control in pricing and driver and company customer service.\n",
      "I've been using Uber for 2 years now. They started off as a great company but they've been steadily increasing their fares. I have noticed a trend with them as of recently. Several Uber drivers will sit in a parking lot and do nothing and jacked up the prices of rides. I go just under 3 miles to work and just under three miles back home. Not a very long distance but they tried to charge me as much as $40 S4 just 3 miles. \n",
      "I took A UBER from Slidell to New Orleans which is about 30 minutes. Cost was ok. But on the way back it charged me 187$ for the same trip. NEVER AGAIN!!! I wouldve been better off to take my own car!!! THIS company should be fined for gouging and taking advantage of people. I do not recommend UBER to nobody!!!\n",
      "Like many others Uber charged me multiple cancellation fees that were driver's fault, not mine. Instead of refunding my Gift Card, they issue me Uber Credit. That credit has not been used for payment on the 30 trips I have made since it was sent to me. I have sent close to 100 messages to HELP and they assured me that if I added more money on my gift card it would be applied on next trip. 30 trips and $350 later, credit still there. After 45 days of constantly getting rides denied for insufficient funds, when my gift card/Uber credit amount that is combined together in payment was more than enough, I went to Houston Greenlight Hub. They too refuse to help me out and actually had security force me off the property. \n",
      "Uber as a company does not care about consumers. First, there is no way to communicate or get support. Second, there is no consistency between the website and the app. What can be done in one cannot in the other and vice versa. Third, the app does not always do what it is told. For instance I wanted to pay with a credit card and it defaulted to another account even though I specifically chose the CC. Fourth, the app rates the rider but does not give feedback. How does a rider know what they did that offended the driver so they can correct it? Finally, the web page and the app are cumbersome. It is extremely ironic that a user has to verify. They are not a robot to access a utility run completely by computers.\n",
      "Try to contact anybody on Uber either by phone or the internet. These idiots that run Uber do not realize that they can also go under. Nobody is too big to fail. I can do without Uber. They can go to hell.\n",
      "I was a driver for Uber 01/17- 04/18. In this time Uber has accused me of multiple accidents. To which I've had none. Uber has accused me of carrying a firearm, to which I don't. To my knowledge Uber manipulates driver ratings in order to keep people at certain levels. They need so many people at a certain rating to keep numbers active. If you choose to work for this pathetic company do it part time, don't do it full time. It's not worth it. If you are forced to work full time start looking for something else.\n",
      "Many people are thinking that Uber can help for earning some money. But it is totally wrong. Uber is already charging very low fare from customers and after all Uber is paying more low to the driver. Few days ago I made a call from Uber as a driver from Albany NY to JFK NY. Which is usually cost in regular taxi service about $350. In this payment the driver is paying for gas charges, toll charges, time duration, safe driving skill and etc. After dropping off to customer, driver must have to come back to his hometown as well. While coming back, the driver is not allowed to pick any passenger from JFK NY legally. After all the driver can save only $150. I got paid $153 only from Uber. And Uber charged $215 from customer. Which also very low. In this whole trip both side I put my life in risk and provided neat and safe ride with expert safe driving skill.\n",
      "UBER charged me for trips on Dec. 29. 2017 to Dec. 31, 2017, but then the second driver for UBER overcharged me for the trips for the dates I have listed above and the first trip was to do an application for a apartment in Wood Village Apartments. Then after that I told him to go to the pharmacy to pick up my vitamins on Capital Street in Jackson MS, then after that I told that second driver to take me back to ** and the trips the second driver for UBER was supposed to take me to is for the particular dates I listed. He overcharged me $333.00 for all those trips and I ended up only having $35.00 left in my account and debit cash management card from Fidelity after the UBER driver took all of my money off my Fidelity debit card ending in **. \n",
      "The upfront price that came up was $37 for a ride from French Quarters to the airport on March 26. I was charged $55. On March 22 we took Uber from airport to the French Quarter and it was $37. It was the same time of day, approx 1:30-2 pm. I put in a complaint to Uber and their response was that there is a delay between the upfront price and the actual price charged. I asked why it would be that much more at the same time of day with no traffic from when we took Uber from airport. No response or offer to refund me the difference. No apologies. Very poor customer service. Don't use Uber because they will show a cheaper price upfront to get you to use them over Lyft but will charge you more. Scam.\n",
      "Uber seems to be using Ride Share to attract customers to purchase flat rate rides to selective customers. I have been a customer for a long time but no one get any type of perks for using their service almost every day. It's not fair that there aren't any services that can be helpful to a woman who has anxiety of taking public transportation. It's very difficult and I feel they take advantage of consumer.\n",
      "Low customer support. Does not have professional customer service. Not proactive and well understand the issue but just promptly answer to meet timeline kpi. I have been contacted an issue for a year and it never been resolved. They assign multiple person to reply on an issue and none of them has just read through the previous email and just randomly answer the initial question by procedure. It makes me feel I am talking to a chat bot with low logical script and takes me too much time to explain in details what is going on. They even copy and paste exactly the same message they had sent to me for 4 times.\n",
      "Thank you for refunding the cancellation charge. And as I said, my first rides withUber have been a pleasure._x000D_Now my more serious concern is being in physical danger when a driver cancels my ride home without warning or cause, will not allow me to re-schedule a ride, and leaves me stranded again, at night, far from home, anywhere in Cuyahoga County. Is there a solution for this very real danger?\n",
      "Last week I ordered an Uber but I canceled it before it arrived and took the bus instead. When I got home I received an email from Uber saying that they had revised my charge. Apparently the driver filed a claim for something Uber called a \"cleaning fee\". I disputed this saying that I had not even entered the vehicle and asked for proof of this claim. They then sent me several photos which showed what appeared to be damage to a seat cushion from a cigarette burn.\n",
      "I ordered Uber in Fla. The driver came promptly. Anyway when I checked my account this driver in Fla. charged me $150.00 for cleaning her car over the above price which was $26.19. Uber stated that the driver sent pic that we spilled and messed up her car. Well my husband and I didn't bring any food and no drinks. We had a suitcase and carry on with no liquids. Also the driver stated she had a customer prior to us that made a mess. So if you decide to take Uber I would take pictures of the inside/out so you don't get ripped off. I myself will never take Uber again.\n",
      "It was around 2:00 am in the morning and trying to get home. The cost of getting home is $24.00, when I was trying to get an Uber it was saying that it would cost me $93.00... WTF? Rip off... who can afford that?!! Took a yellow cab instead! I have nothing good to say with respect to Uber as they are ripping people off and sometimes get away with it... that should not be allowed! What if a senior citizen is trying to get home and they live on their pension. When I complained about this to Uber they said because there was limited drivers... so in other words you have to bribe your drivers that work for Uber?? They are losing business from me and I will be spreading the word on this matter!!! BE CAREFUL when paying from your credit card on your app on your phone that you don't accidentally assume you are going to be paying what you normally pay because UBER will not reimburse you... they will tell you to go and pound sand!\n",
      "Got picked up at airport after inputting my correct destination (about 50 minutes away). Next day I saw that Uber had charged me for 2 trips -- the first was 0.04 miles to go about a half a block at the airport -- for $18!! This charge is totally bogus; I never ordered that trip. Why in the world I have?? At that rate, ($18 for 0.04 miles) a mile-long trip would cost $45,000! Uber refused to refund me the $18. Never again will I take Uber. (I have to add, though, that my driver seemed a bit shady. I wonder if he somehow arranged for the bogus 0.04-mile trip so he'd get more money.)\n",
      "The drivers constantly cancel and charge late fees. Customer service is only reachable through the app (no phone #), and they're useless. The little money potentially saved isn't worth the hassle, from what used to be an OK company and idea. SMH.\n",
      "I ordered food from Flying Biscuit through Uber Eats. The food arrived very late, cold, and missing the coffee that I ordered. The driver said that it must have been given to someone else and did not have the food place in a sleeve to keep it warm. I ordered eggs, grits, potatoes, and sledgehammer coffee. The food could not be reheated as the texture and taste would be affected so I had no choice but to toss it. I send several complaints to Uber who said that they would credit me for the coffee ($6.99 and no credit to account as yet), but I would not be credited for the food. Sledgehammer $6.99, Egg-Straordinary Breakfast $8.99, Signature Chicken Sausage Patties $4.29, Busy Area fee $1.65, Booking Fee $4.99, Tax $1.80. After paying this much for a breakfast for one person, shouldn't the food be eatable? ***GIANT RIP-OFF*** I feel violated as a consumer.\n",
      "I've been using UBER faithfully over the years. However, I will be switching over to Lyft. Their lost item policy is reasonable unlike UBER. You can leave an item in the car and the driver can take it without any repercussions. I don't think it's a good policy at all. I contacted the driver numerous times about my iPhone and tracked it. He ignored me intentionally. His intentions were to keep the phone.\n",
      "I've already left a bad review on the app but since their a Trump supporting company and to stupid to know how to make their crap work I can't edit it. I'm a traumatic brain injury person who almost fell 3 times on my way home because they can't give you a proper estimate of their drivers and I had to walk home in below freezing temperatures without a jacket. Their app is just bloatware and they think just because they support the illegitimate president they are safe from public opinion! If you are reading this and have a android, do yourself a favor and get the lyft app!\n",
      "I have been driving for 3 months. Blocked for no set reason. They say my rating dropped. But did not explain how. I have 116 five star ratings. 94 percent acceptance rate. But won't tell me why my rating dropped. I experienced technical difficulties on reception. Had to cancel riders because navigation crashed. You do not get as much as advertised and some rides are 20 minutes away.\n",
      "Uber - Ride arrived as scheduled. Driver pleasant and professional. Uber sent notice that could be an increase due to demand at this time. A 30 minute; 7 mile ride quoted at $17.11. Was charged $34. Taxi - Same time and distance on return trip. $21. Believe it's my first, and last time with Uber.\n",
      "I had a worst Uber pool experience today. There were pickups in the opposite directions. For the 10 mins drive it was showing about 40 mins. Driver was not able check the next pick up also. I had to get down from the cab as I was not getting proper information.\n",
      "I have one of the most traumatic experience in my life driving for Uber. The rider request for his daughter high school to be picked, the person who requested says he can't see the route which a 10 min took 34 because of the road construction & accident. The person nonstop telling where to get out but I was stuck on the road but after I arrived he came to yelling, \"She is my daughter! You don't know who you are messing with\". And try to open my car door. Locked it but he punched my car glass and shatter it. Now I am shaking. He keeps following me yelling.\n",
      "Prebooking a day ahead and been canceled by Uber two minute before pick-up time. Owing Uber has problem get payment from PayPal.

At 08:07 am 08-03-2018 received a txt from ** that you can not arrange my order, owing to has problem to get payment from PayPal. I wonder what type of attitude you are? You should connect me within hour after my booking to solve it out, not until final pick-up time. I am very unhappy and disappointed to Uber.\n",
      "I've been taking Uber to work and back, while the car gets fixed. I have a few things I'm pissed about. First for one thing I had to go to work this morning and every time a driver accepted my ride, they would cancel on their way to pick me up, that happened 3 times. I didn't want to be late for work. One of the drivers suddenly texted me and said he can't do my ride and the idiot tells me to cancel. I got a charge for canceling. Then another idiot driver that accepted to give me a ride, he stopped driving. ( I saw him on the map) just sitting there a long time, he texted me finally and asked me if I would mind if he changes vehicles? I didn't answer him, so the weirdo canceled my ride. I'm very angry at this point, so I tried Lyft (which is much better) and I got a ride from them right away. I made it to work on time.\n",
      "Until a week ago I would always prefer and use Uber as a choice. It was good service at the affordable price rate. The rate was always below the yellow cab rate. Since a week Uber started increasing rate. It is I think based upon the demand and area you are travelling to. It cost now almost 40% more than normal rate. I find this very unethical as it is done w/o informing customer. I feel being cheated and I am so pissed off that I don't want to use Uber anymore. The other day I got a ride from Sunnyside to Manhattan with Uber at $34 and on my way back I took a yellow cab which cost $20. This is unbelievably ridiculous.\n",
      "I have used UberRush multiple times to deliver flower arrangements from my floral shop. I had a problem in November of 2017 and in February of 2018. When you call the support number, it is routed out of the country always. With all due respect, often the person trying to help has a strong accent which can make it difficult to understand what they are saying as well as, often, the reason for my call is often lost in translation. WHY IS UBER UNWILLING TO PROVIDE HELP WITHIN THE UNITED STATES?\n",
      "FRAUD CHARGES on my bank acct. Waiting for a response from UBER is almost impossible. I had to message them from FACEBOOK! They point you in the direction to download their app. Why would I want to do that? I want the fraud charges reversed. My bank will be on it and then a consumer report to Oregon Attorney General. I don't even use UBER nor do I even know anybody that does.\n",
      "On Friday, February 23rd I requested a pick up from a doctor's office back to the office for a conference call. The Uber driver arrived (based on my phone tracking display) then canceled my ride (not sure why -- but can speculate that he saw my race and didn't want me in his vehicle. It took 10 minutes to get another Uber driver and I was late for my call.\n",
      "The company is worst in consumer affairs as it does not have a proper means of communication in case of any dispute/issue. The only option is to write your query in the help section of the app, but that also does not get solved. In my case, recently I was trying to book the ride but due to less balance in my payment, I was not been allowed to book it so I changed the payment method to Cash and booked the ride and paid the cash to the driver at the end of the trip. However, while trying to book subsequent ride, I noticed that the payment for earlier ride was o/s, for which I tried to find the Uber's Customer Care no. which I could not found anywhere so was forced to taken other modes for travelling for the subsequent rides and I put up my query in the Help Section.\n",
      "Lately I must question Uber's employment screening practices. For instance last Sunday on February 18th I used Uber to commute to work. I came downstairs 30 minutes early for a seven minute commute. I connected with first drive and that appeared to be 8 minutes out. When my Uber approached the 1 minute out mark the driver canceled with no notice. I was picked up again and I immediately call the Uber driver and was sent to voicemail 3 separate times. When my cell displayed 'arriving' the driver called and stated he was at the back gate. I explained to driver that I was at the front gate and I did not know the location of back gate. I also stated I attempted to call 3 times to inform him (\"Chico\") that I was at front gate. His exact words were, \"Bye Girl\" and he immediately disconnected and canceled trip. Another driver picked me up and I arrived at work at exactly 11 pm. I got to work and immediately put in a complaint and nothing was done.\n",
      "I drove Uber for some time as a part time. It is so disgusting. They deactivated my account for the reason that I was driving slow in heavy traffic and I was saying it a good weather when the rider does not like it. When they deactivated my account I did not feel good for some time because I began to play with it. You cannot make money but it was a fun. But don't do it. Consider some of the following issues: How do you deal with crash? How do you deal with your depreciation? You are actually making minimum wage. How do you deal when you are deactivated? Who would you contact if there is a serious issue? You will be on your own and will go to depression and your family will leave you.Never drive for Uber or Kick them out from Canada.\n",
      "I drove for Uber in 2016 and had an accident. Uber's insurance is a low ball tactic, fraudulent, lying, scamming company. I noticed fraud in my accident and no one did nothing. All these false claims on the insurance papers. I later discovered it was done on purpose. Even the police report was a lie and never accepted. I contacted Uber and Farmers and they have done nothing. However, I see how their partnership in Pittsburgh works against the victim and engages in stalking, harassment and mail fraud. Til this day my mail is stolen or given away to these fraudsters and there was a breach but that's on a hush now. I still suffer from injuries and have no help. They target you and these people who are involved have greed. That's why it was done.\n",
      "I had used Uber service to travel from Raheja Garden, Wanowrie to Pune Airport in Pool category on 8th Feb. I was supposed to Pay Rs 130.50 for the ride. I had paid Rs 200 to driver at the Pune Airport. He was not having the change so he went to bring the change. He asked me to wait and told me that he will park it and get the change from a shop. He didn't returned for a long time. I called him, initially he picked you the phone but later on, he stopped picking the phone too. Since I was getting late for my flight, I proceeded for my journey. Today I am back to Pune and thus writing you the mail. This was my first ride with Uber but with bad experience. When Complained to UBER, received a poor response.\n",
      "I was attempting to walk from my house to an Uber car that was waiting for me on December 27, 2017. I slipped on the ice (broke my hip) and couldn't get up. When the Uber driver unsuccessfully attempted to load me into the car, and determined I couldn't board, he tossed a water bottle to me (which I couldn't retrieve as I was completely immobilized), left me in the middle of the street, and drove off. Luckily a neighbor came momentarily and called 911, or I might have died of shock and exposure. \n",
      "I received an email receipt for a Uber ride I never took. I had signed up for Uber 4 months ago but have never used it. Although the charge was only $7 I told Uber my account had been hacked.

      "My mom who is 62 and handicap requested an Uber carseat for her and my 20 month daughter on 7th Ave. Kmart on 34th St. in NYC today. They sent a shared Uber. Then the driver said he would meet them at Grand Central Station which is at least 5 Avenues away or pick her up in front of a hotel. He never arrived and charged for a trip that neither my mom or child was in the car! You can see in the email images that there is no way in hell that short of a trip could have been $18! My mom called Dial 7 and they took her and the baby home. This is outright fraud.\n",
      "it would be a bit unfair to many other great uber drivers i have met but i was getting really angry after some of the drivers cancelled my trips. damn, they are suck. seriously, my stupid drivers were $#*!ing crazy. he called me to ask me where i was, i told him the pick up point i was standing at but because i was in the other side of the road, i tried to tell him that but he talked to me in his broken english with an aggressive voice. he didnt even notice the name of the streets i tried to tell him and misheard what i was saying. he hung up the phone without saying anything and i realised that he was in the wrong direction and i tried to contact him but he didnt pick up the phone. after a while he cancelled my trip. suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. i am too sick of these types of uber drivers. plz recruiting and tracking your driver selectively.\n",
      "I have created an Uber account recently in Portland, US. When I try to use the free first ride which is the referral ride, it throws some error. I must have written to customer care some 10 times since yesterday and they are so inefficient even to resolve small issues like this. They have been giving some lame excuses and suggestions, to restart my app and all. Worst of all, they even stopped responding after some time. I have not been able to book a ride because of this. I have never expected such a worst service from Uber, when they claim that customer service is their first priority.\n",
      "I was overcharged by Uber recently. I was shown a fare of 787.66 and at the at of the trip the fare was 1875 and I had to pay it. Later I contacted Uber and they said it happened due to GPS error and they refunded me the difference in Uber credits. Now, I don't understand who has given them the right to convert my money into Uber credits!!! I have no intention of using Uber again after this bad experience.\n",
      "My little sister's flight with AA was canceled last night due to crew not showing up... something BS about how they worked past a certain amount of hours. This is gross incompetence on AA's part. Then Uber has no cars available, but charges me 56 USD on hold on my card. I then get a Lyft to bring my little sister back. Now it's the next day, I try to get an Uber, the fake taxi shows up and tells us she can't drive to LAX... so, no my little sister is on a time crunch, again, I use Lyft to get her to the airport. I check my card, Uber has put $112 USD on hold... FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK? What a bunch of **.\n",
      "Ordered food for a small group of people and instead of calling me to ask where my apartment was and have me come get the food, the driver just cancelled the order and drove away without any notice or explanation. I tried contacting support and they gave me a cookie cutter response (with multiple typos) that was of no help whatsoever.\n",
      "I asked to be picked up from Uber on 2/13/18. It was really cold out that day. When I made my appointment they said 5 min away. I waited 20 min. Then I got a phone call from the driver saying he wouldn't be able to pick me up. This happened 3 times with other drivers! I finally got a guy to pick me up. After bribing him with a big tip. Then I get the charge from Uber it was more than it was supposed to be. Come to find out after complaining they bumped me up to UberXL. Even after telling them everything I went through to get a driver to pick me up and that I didn't order XL they still would give me back the extra money they charged me. This company is a joke and wouldn't recommend anyone to use this service. I give it no stars!\n",
      "Thank you (customer service rep). Yesterday Feb 14, 2018 I picked up three pool riders at the airport going to Seattle. I estimated in my head roughly $20 each, or a $60 payout to me. When the earnings finally loaded, I was given $35. I assumed it was for the longest of the three riders. No! It was the total I was being paid for all three riders!!! I checked what Uber collected and was equally shocked to find out you charged the riders, including discounts, a total of $96!!! You used my car to load up three different fares from the airport to Seattle. You charged the riders, and were paid $96 for my time and effort driving them. The only problem is, you only deemed it necessary to pay me one dollar for every three you collected from them. It IS highway robbery. You are robbing me (on the Highway) of my just portion of the fares you collect from the public for my time, effort and risk.\n",
      "I've been using Uber regularly for the past month to go to and from work, all of the a sudden in the past 2 days my fare to work has increased by $3 and is the same from work to home. When I dared to question them I am being blown off and saying I accepted the fare so I shouldn't question it. I accepted the fare because I needed to get to work and wasn't about to be late by $3 an issue I thought could be resolved after, they claim to be upfront in their pricing but charges are not consistent which is unfair and unethical. I know if I call a local taxi my fare is the same no matter what time of the day it is.\n",
      "In Salt Lake City my destination was changed after I  entered uber car. I confirmed with uber driver my requested destination at my pickup location.  Then again when he passed the street I going to.  He took me to the location on app that I had not requested.  I jumped out of the car fearing for my life. Do not drive off with any car service without seeing your requested destination on their app.\n",
      "I have been an UBER rider for more than a year. Here in Richmond VA, United States. Never pay attention on charges of UBER 'cause I trusted the company and my account was healthy, good balance most of the time. I used UBER twice a day going to work. I got no car, sometimes exceptionally more than two times, but my usual is two. I start noticing that on my pending transaction of the bank I have instead of 2 charges, 4 charges... up to 6 charges on one day. So I decided NOT TO TRUST and check all my transactions and validated them with the receipts they send to the email when I then close the trip. I found more than 5 overcharges. \n",
      "Ubers refund policy is a joke; dont waste your time. I had a very legitimate claim and Uber has been sending me back and forth numerous emails for just 16 dollar and they will just play you around. I always thought Uber is a reputable reliable company until today when i tried the service and realized how much they are fraudulent and their site designed to steal people money.\n",
      "0n 2/16/18 @ about 4pm I request a ride from Uber (Dave) whom called me to confirm he was picking me up in 5 mins but he cancelled at the last minute. I then arranged another ride with Mark (the app said he would meet me in 29 mins) and waited for him in the freezing cold for more than 30 mins. He then called and said he required additional time to pick me up as he had a problem with his last fare. At this point I told him to never mind as I was going to call a taxi which I did... I wasn't going to risk waiting in the cold to this gang that can't shoot straight. I sent them an email to delete my account after this fiasco.\n",
      "I booked a ride from Uber from a bar in Poblado, MedellÃ­n. The following day they indicated an additional charge of 140,000 COP (around $50 US) for damage to the car. They claim the damage was paint on the seat of car and a torn rear seat. I cannot figure out why they think a tourist would be carrying paint. We took a calm ride from Poblado to Laureles and the following day I get this charge. I have been fighting with Uber over this but they just keep saying, \"Sorry we believe our driver.\" The driver did provide some images of the damage. However, I was not the one who did it.\n",
      "I went to the help section in Uber app and the following: \"I confirmed my trip price at $16.46 but I was charged $30. Why did my trip price change? I should be charged my confirmed price. Please refund me the difference... thanks.\" They wrote back: \"I reviewed your trip, and can see that the price you were charged $30.03 matches the price you were shown before you confirmed the trip. If there's a significant delay between entering your location and confirming your trip, your price may sometimes change. If that's the case, we'll always ask you to re-confirm the new price.\" \n",
      "I used to drive for Uber and I quit last year. I have been trying to get my tax reports for days now and have emailed and tried to call Uber. I have received one email that seemed to ignore the problem I was having, and the phone number won't let you speak to a human, it just hangs up on you. I have been unable to log in due to having a different number than when I worked for them, and when I try to log in, it wants me to enter a verification code sent via SMS. I explained this multiple times, but the one email I got back was a link to the Tax dashboard... which I can't access because I can't log in. Lyft updated my phone number easily, but Uber has yet to respond to my follow up emails, or even update my number. Getting extremely frustrated with this company and am very glad I stopped working for them. This is just one issue I've had with them among many.\n",
      "I would like to start off with the that I only use Uber because I live in Las Vegas and it's easier to get home from work at night, now that being said, thinking I was doing the \"smart\" thing I decided to use Uber Gift cards as form of payment due to the fact Uber has been hacked several times. Well once again today my Uber driver kept my ride going long after I finished the trip and once again I was DOUBLE charged, and once again I'm left to just hope and pray to get a response from \"Uber support\". What a horrible company. Very dishonest as a whole! I would rather pay double for a taxi than be stolen from! I've received better customer service at 24 hour fast food restaurants!\n",
      "I noticed that I did not get a refund for a wrong cancellation fee from Uber. It is annoying enough to wait for a driver who never shows up but even worse to be charged for it. I went back 2 months to see if any of my cancellations fees were posted and they we not! Tried to contact Uber, no number to call, except posting it through their website, which says that my refund has already been processed.\n",
      "I started an account with Uber back in December preparing for a trip. I played with the app a bit to learn how to use it. When I tried to actually use it the first time after depositing a $50 gift card it did not work, ended up taking a taxi to airport. Eventually I discovered that the app no longer recognized my email address or telephone number. After numerous attempts to rectify the problem with Uber I have gotten nowhere, they only communicate thru email and seems that they don't understand your problem or just fail to communicate. I have no other recourse except to make complaints and warn others.\n",
      "My son book a Uber ride for me and my wife and for 10 blocks maybe 10 minutes ride we got charge $50.00 dollars. That is a rip off. We never going to use Uber again. Better to ride in a legal yellow cab.\n",
      "I love Uber, but this a problem they need to fix. While on my way home, a very young impatient driver veered into another lane of freeway traffic to avoid a delay caused by an accident. I had a closed bottle of coke in my hand. It fizzed very little and some got on me. Not enough for me to panic about. We ended up having to take a very long route back to my house due to her impatience. Being a nice person I didn't say anything. When I got out I checked the back seat which was stained and filthy, to make sure I didn't leave anything behind. No coke spill, nothing. We exchanged pleasantry. Nothing, \"oh you ruined my car!\" Nothing. Charged $90 clean up fee... I will dispute this at my bank, at Uber. I don't think it is the company, but drivers who need to know that some people will make their lives miserable if they are very dishonest.\n",
      "This is my second day with Uber as a driver. Already have issues... went to cash out my earnings of $138 and received a message that I don't have access. Call and was told you have to wait 1 week to receive earnings. Asked to speak with a Supervisor and was informed there is no such individual available because they don't have one. After insisting on either a supervisor or a team lead the customer representative still insisted there was no such person. Then after standing my ground remarkably he has a supervisor.\n",
      "UBER IS A HUGE SCAM, they quote you one price when you request the Uber and then they change the price after you request your ride, they basically double the original price that they quote to you first, this is a huge scam and if you don't check on time they can easily scam you by doubling the price that you never agreed to. I am not done with reporting Uber to every place I can because this is a rip off... I advise everyone to stick to regular taxi cab service.\n",
      "Used Uber Eats 1 time in Atlanta GA, now my card has been used for other transactions to Uber. No way to let Uber know the possibility of their drivers selling credit information. Will never use this service again!\n",
      "On Jan 28th 2018. Car service cost $4.60. For me today to church pickup was CXL by driver so he will get $5.00. I'm standing in the middle of the street and he drives off while I'm speaking to him on the phone. I was dressed for church. This is the second time this occurred. I'm cancelling this service. I want a refund. Placing a stop payment on this transaction. Car ** Honda Accord. I was on the phone with him and he still left... Why???\n",
      "Well I have been driving for Uber for 1 week and if there is one thing I learnt is how cheap people really are. The worst invention in taxi service history has to be this Uber pool thing. Everyone and their mother picks Uber pool because it's cheaper than Uber X but refuse to want to deal with other passengers in the Uber vehicle. So not only do I lose money with Uber pool but I get to deal with people that don't comprehend what Uber pool is. \n",
      "I don't mind riding Uber. The only issue I have with Uber is some of their policy. It happen a lot to me that my Uber driver cancel because they lost and can't found where I'm located at the moment. And Uber charge me for the driver cancellation. That's not my fault if they lost. And I have to pay for that. When they refund you they give you a credit to use for your next trip. Uber is funny so they never lose and we already lose. I'm not happy about that and want Uber to start refund in our card. Thank God the trip was only 4$. Imagine a trip of 30$ that a driver decide to cancel because they unable to find you. UBER CHANGE THAT POLICY OR I WON'T USE YOU ANYMORE.\n",
      "THIS IS AN EXTREMELY URGENT MATTER AS I AM LOOKING TO FILE FORMAL LEGAL CHARGES ON UBER CORPORATION IN SAN FRANCISCO as their malice & lack of proper technology has caused me to lose approx. $700 income which I have screenshots as proof, but they made a mockery of me by ignoring my very emotional one hour visit, providing all of my proof, & they ever intended on helping me at all. The supervisor promised to get San Francisco headquarters involved which he never did as I never received any reimbursement to income loss or an explanation to why they are allowing this harassment to continue! I was given \"inside\" information on why this is happening to me only in the day shift and if it is true, Uber can be shut down for this!\n",
      "In July of 2017 I used Uber Pool to go 1.5 miles from the Atlanta airport to my offices near the airport. I was quoted $5 to $7 dollars before I accepted. (I used Google Maps to book it, which Uber allows. If Google was the problem, which no one at Uber ever said, their problem should be with Google.) I got charged over $13. I wrote Uber and in their response they emphasized that what I am quoted before the trip will always be the price, \"no surprises,\" then went on to say they had reviewed the trip, and the charge was in line with what it should have cost, so \"you're good.\"\n",
      "They claimed my gift card didn't exist. Then said it had been used up. Then found it. Then charged my credit card anyway. Then refunded the charge. Then lost the balance of the gift card. Then said it didn't exist. Then stopped communicating. Caveat emptor. There is no customer service worth mentioning.\n",
      "I think it's very inconsiderate and inappropriate that you corporate people do not address the issue that your drivers have with this so called support team. I have been screwed over so many times this week by your support. We are pushed against a wall and there is nothing we can do but accept whatever resolution your so called specialist come up with. Which is so unacceptable. We send yall a grievance or an issue and yall refer it right back to the same people who did nothing to solve the problem only made it worse. My account keeps getting locked so I can't get my instant pay every... Every month. Why... I have my phone which the app is on my phone and you have to use my phone to get in my account to swipe my instant pay... Smh.\n",
      "On or about the middle of December I purchased a $50 gift card as an Xmas gift. It took Uber almost 3 weeks to send it to him. He did not get it by Xmas, but I overlooked it. He does not have a car so uses Uber often. I live very far from him and he did not know how to add the card to his app so had to wait till 1/22 for me to go visit him. Upon trying to put a code that is required in order to add funds to his account, I peeled off the code and the code was unreadable. After numerous phone call to Uber's customers service number which brings you through a 3 question on winning a trip to Florida, Bahamas etc. which was a total waste of my time the person tells me I need to purchase another card and then they will refund my money. I am so far already out $50 I will not give them another $50 of my money. I am very frustrated and out $50. Buyer beware just give a Visa card and don't purchase an Uber card. This is horrible.\n",
      "Today I request two rides one to work and the other home. Both fares were a lower price and once I confirmed the ride, my charge was almost double. This is like bait and switch. Not fair to the consumer. I made a complaint and the person that handled it looked at the wrong date, she said I was compensated, I was not. So I came here. If they are doing this to me they are doing it to a lot of other people. Thank you.\n",
      "Uber used to be the go to, now it's basically owned by third world. I paid for two rides and the idiot got me to destination 1 and cancelled and took my money basically. If you are in NJ say NOOO to the scam artist Yousaf in a Honda Accord license plate **. Another guy had the nerve to question me about my location and I was only 6 minutes away from my location. I almost got in 3 accidents in the last 2 days. One girl talking on the phone. The other guy I got yesterday was so nervous and scared and he admitted to me he's scared of highways. I'm done with Uber and if you had any brains people of NJ in the Wayne area you would too. Nothing but barely English speaking con artists.\n",
      "I am being charge for a fare with Uber that is not mine. They keep telling me that a payment method that I used is associated with another account, so therefore the fare that has not been paid is mine. Then when I asked them to do research, they sent me an email that said for me to log back in using my email address. When I did that, they completely removed my account and gave me the account that was associated with the fare that had not been paid. When I told them that this was not my account. They emailed back and said it was and that the fare was consistent with other fares on my account. I told them this is incorrect. The account that was mine, I had used mine as early as 12/14/2017. This account was had not been active since 3/25/17. They refuse to remove this account from under my name.\n",
      "Uber picked up my children in one neighborhood and randomly dropped them off in another neighborhood. The driver kicked them out of the car in a random neighborhood when his Uber software crashed stating that he would have no way to get paid for the ride (what happened to the safety of the children in the random neighborhood **). Zero excuse for this! We could have compensated the driver on his arrival. Who the ** drops off children in a random location??? Worst part of this ordeal? Uber double charged us 8.57 for this ride and we had to go pick up the children. Uber never refunded any of the money, so we're out 17.14 - thank goodness our kids were ok...\n",
      "I live in a city that has a cab company. The distances are short. I did a check. Uber charges the same amount for the same ride. I guess under certain circumstances it may be cheaper but for now I am staying with my cab company.\n",
      "I was picked up on time by Antoinne in a White Dodge Dart. The roads had a lot of snow and he did not drive very carefully. His car skidded a little at one point and he ran a red light. I had to pray he would slow down. He looked like a very shady kid. I am a professional lady and he barely talked at all.\n",
      "DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD. I set up their app just so I would have it handy and had to give them my credit card to do so.  Months later I got a charge from them even though I never used them.  I called their customer service and got a recording saying the number was out of service. I called the number from my credit card charge and was told to leave a message on their web site.\n",
      "Uber failed me as a customer! I was scammed out of a cleaning fee when the driver submitted a fraudulent claim against me. Uber says they have measures in place to catch false and fraudulent claims. That turned out to be a big fat lie! They never ONCE researched the validity of the picture submitted. Instead, I was accused and told \"no response needed\" at every turn. \n",
      "I have had multiple experiences with the driver canceling and since it was over 15-20 mins I WAS CHARGED A FEE. Seriously? The driver cancels and I have to pay a fee???? Then when I messaged Uber they gave me an Uber credit? I don't use Uber often enough for a credit. I paid with debit card and wanted a refund on my debit card. It's very irritating. When I contact customer service about it they apologize and do nothing. Worthless! I will stick with Lyft.\n",
      "I paid Uber in advance to pick me up at Jackson Memory Hospital on 1/16/2018 at 6:30 pm for a trip to the Airport 'MIA' for driver with broken English could not follow the GPS correctly to pick me up. 1 whole Hour waiting. I was charge 5 time by five different driver that never made it to their pick-up, I never seen so incompetence driver that couldn't find the Biggest Hospital in Miami that been around for 70 years in the same location. Uber, I want my money back on my credit card or I will sue you in court plus attorney fee.\n",
      "I lost my phone in the Uber last night. Attached to the phone was my credit card with a large limit on it. We panicked and cancelled the card. The next morning we called the Uber hotline and they had the driver call us. The driver searched the car and found the phone and the credit card. He drove 30 miles to return it to us. His name was Felipe and he drives in Ft. Myers Beach, FL. We were so impressed with his efforts to find the phone and to return it to us. He even questioned us to be sure we were the folks who ordered the Uber so he didn't give the phone to the wrong people. So wonderful to know that there are honest people out there who still care!! Thanks Uber Driver, Felipe.\n",
      "I called an Uber ride. I called in plenty of time to make my bus which was not scheduled to leave until 9:40 AM! Since the ride was initially accepted at 8:50 or so, I had plenty of time to make it to 1727 Bedford Ave in Brooklyn, NY. But, Jorge CANCELLED the trip unbeknownst to me! After he called me on my phone to tell me he was in front of FedEx, which by the way, shares a building with the hotel from which I called him! I was staying in the NU Hotel on Smith St around the corner, less than 100 feet from where I was in the lobby at 85 Smith St. \n",
      "I have been a driver for a number of years with Uber. They are big time crooks! Customers will show the driver the fares they are being charged (ex. $50) and Uber only pays the driver $11.95. The cut is supposed to be 80% driver and 20% Uber. They are big time liars and cheaters!! The so called 24/7 support line is also a Big Joke! It is outsourced to India and there is a serious language barrier. They never have a Supervisor available, however one will call you back. It never happens! They will deactivate your account in a heartbeat once you figure out their crooked and deceitful system of Lies and call them out on it! They can access all of your personal information through your Android, make it disappear, and blackout your phone with their technology.\n",
      "Yup. So Uber claimed that a 24 hour McDonald's was open. Ordered 30$ worth of food. They said after 30 minutes they couldn't find a driver and canceled my order. I called back and made sure Drivers were available. They said they were. I placed the same order again. $30. Half hour later turned out that McDonald's wasn't 24 hours and they canceled the order again. Found out that McDonald's doesn't open until 5. Ok fine. Waited until 5 and placed a new $30 order. After half an hour again they had no drivers and canceled my order. Waited until 6am when village inn was open. Called to make sure a driver was available. Ordered another $30 in food. Again. A driver was not available. I called again to complain. \n",
      "I reserved a taxi from my hostel to the airport which at that time was supposed to be between 11-19 dollars. Then 3 minutes before my taxi came I got a text that the price was going up (there was no exact amount mentioned). I had to catch my flight so I didn't want to cancel my trip. Eventually the price went from between 11-19 dollar to 30,40 dollar?! I complained about it at Uber but they won't give me the change back. Never am I going to use Uber again. This was the first and last time.\n",
      "I wanted to finally write a review regarding obtaining help from Uber as a driver. This company absolutely sucks when a driver needs help with the app. I was driving with no issues for 4 weeks and then was placed as â€œwaitlistedâ€ for no reason at all as my record is spotless. After 8 weeks with no support at all or responses to weekly e-mails to the â€œHELPâ€ feature all I got back was â€œI understand but please wait for 5-7 days for review.\" Well it has been over 8 weeks during the busiest time of the year and still no help. Your company absolutely sucks with help.\n",
      "Neither I, nor my friend had used Uber before but had heard their drivers were friendly from a friend of mine. On New Year's Eve of this year (2018) we (my friend and I) first used them to take us a couple miles from where we were to a club and it cost us $10, not including the tip. This was around 9:30 p.m. The driver was polite and was there within minutes of us ordering it. No problem. At the end of our night then, around 1:15 a.m. we called again to have them take us home. Now my house is roughly 10 min from the club so however any miles that is, I don't know, but when we ordered the Uber from the club the amount came to a little over $47. YES, I said over $47! And that was just to get ME home, without tip, and not even getting my girlfriend home! \n",
      "My experience with drivers is good in general. My issue is with Uber as a company. I won a certain number of rides with Uber ($25 off of a number of rides). I was able to use it up to a certain point. All of a sudden, Uber posted a different promotion on my account. This prevented me from using my original promotion (the way it works the last promo added is used first). I complained and after days and days of going back and forth with emails, I was able to use my promo again. Then, suddenly they changed the expiration date of the promotion. Now it expired on 1/2/18 instead of 4/30/18 as originally stated.\n",
      "I have been using Uber for rides home from work for a year. I always pay the same. Today my 11.00 ride costs 20.52. Same time, same days. That is more than regular taxi charges. Ok, Uber. I hear you're getting sued many times, now I know why.\n",
      "I signed up for Uber last night to check rates for travel from my hotel to a concert I'm going to next month.

We got a call telling us he thought we were out on the road and he is leaving. My card was charged 6$. I have tried several times to contact Uber for a refund and no response. I would love every cent back. I am not going to pay for a lazy driver who want to collect under false pretense. The driver name is Linson, drives Hyundai Accent **. Need my money back.\n",
      "Uber's rules to ride are very unfair to consumers. Today, we got a Uber to take us to Fairfax, 30 minutes from Arlington. When the guy arrived, not only was his car visibly dirty, old and making loud noises, when we got in it smelled like my grandfather who owned and worked on a farm with pigs, when he use to come home at the end of the day. Yet, we had very little choice but ride â€” unless, as in the past, we refused and get charged $24 anyway. Which brings me to my next issue with Uber â€” there have been times we've ordered a car, got downstairs in the time it would take, and the car is gone! We get charged anyway. Unfair and ridiculous. \n",
      "**. That is the driver contact number who has no patience for his customers. My son ordered Uber, and the time he received his message, he went out but the driver had left by then... and ignored his calls, leaving him in a road that barely has any car passing from there. Then he finally replied and told him that he waited for so long... Seriously!! Isn't there a charge for this time? The surprise is, when I called him to ask him to go back, he refused, and the second surprise is that my son had to pay for the car that was cancelled by Uber not by him... Great service.\n",
      "Gave wrong rating for the driver by mistake and asked customer care for editing the review. Answer was big NO to it. Sometimes people make mistakes and should be given a chance to correct it. My driver given an excellent service and I gave one star by mistake I felt very bad about. I spend too much time with customer service for helping to correct it. They said driver will not see who wrote the review so I needn't worry about it.\n",
      "I waited over 20 mins for 3 different uber drivers. I got charged the cancellation fee because my stupid driver cancelled on me as it looked like on the app he was getting lost. He made like 3 u turns on the street before giving up and said I never popped out for my pickup. I'm on a public st by the bus stop. Other people were getting picked up by uber on the same corner I was and they all got their rides faster than me. The reason why uber didn't return my refund is because it past the 30 days which I understand but I didn't get my notification until it was too late and on top of that they said the fee is to compensate the driver for his time spent driving to my location. Are you kidding me? Driver never showed up. He most likely picked up another rider on the way. I was at a crowded baseball event. If we can track the driver on the uber app, uber should be able to track to see if the driver ever arrived to the pickup location. What a joke.\n",
      "After driving for 2 weeks for Uber, I was expecting the $300 bonus that was promised after 50 rides. However, when I called, they said that since I made more than that, I'm not eligible for it. I was very mad and expected to receive the bonus in addition to whatever I made. However, they scammed me from the bonus as well as other drivers. DO NOT work or ride for them. They are an unethical company and scam their drivers from bonuses. I will not drive for them again and will discourage anyone from driving or riding for them again!\n",
      "I have 35 dollars credits from Amex for Uber. When I made a purchase with credit in Uber Eats it only applies 1.61 dollar credit to my purchase, and I paid $31.51 when I still over $33 credit in the account. I contact customer service, and they told me they can't do anything about it. What a ** company.\n",
      "When I applied with Uber for a drivers position everything went smooth. It only took 3 days to get approved. Then that same day everything turned into a nightmare. I unloaded the driver app. and was reading the legal documents which is required when all of a sudden it sent me to driving app. and I hadn't even finish or accepted what I had read. I could not find a place to get help. Then I get an email saying that my insurance expires on December the 26th. When I finally get someone online I tell them I sent them 2 Insurance cards. One that is the present card and one that is the renewal card and it is for 2 cars. The rest of the story is too long but I finally told them to call Geico. I can't believe that I was accepted in 3 days and I lasted 1 hour. I could have made them money. Oh well.\n",
      "I received a promo code from an event I was attending for $10 off the Uber, but instead the app would only apply the pre-existing 40% off the next 10 ride promo that was already activated previously in the app. I contacted customer support through the app to rectify and refund the difference of $5.13. Each time they replied with a scripted email that stated the last promo code added is the first to be applied and they cannot switch the order they are applied. First, their statement was incorrect because the app did not work as they explained and when I stated this they sent the same scripted response to me. This is deceptive practices and their refusal to fix over $5.13 is ridiculous.\n",
      "The worse company  EVER!_x000D_A GROUP of thieves. Was a complete nightmare That I went  through._x000D_I booked to Canada from Orlando and they sent me to New York. I found out when the confirmation came._x000D_Took over 2 hours on the phone been hang up. And I couldn't have my money back on time. _x000D_DONT EVER  USE THIS COMPANY\n",
      "Shortly after opening a Uber account, I was fraudulently charged for a Uber ride. My daughter uses and suggested how safe it is. I was in Florida boarding a plane to Wis, I received a call from an individual who asked \"where pick up\" in very broken English. I told him i was boarding a plane and did not request, or need a ride. When I landed in Wis, to my dismay I was billed for a Uber driver driving from Wis airport to my Daugher's house. I was shocked! I immediately tried to contact Uber by phone. Only to find there is no way to contact Uber by phone, even in emergencies! I even had airport police assist to  no avail. I then went on Uber website to file request for refund. After numerous emails and providing supporting info to Uber customer support, the refund was denied. Uber position was a driver drove from airport to my daughter's house which I had in Uber favorites with No Rider! Really scary!! My daughter is concerned after I told her. I also provided a phone #  and requested Uber to call to no avail. After denial by Uber, I did file a formal request with American Express, and provided same info and support as to Uber. After reviewing, to my relief,  AE placed charge on hold and put a perm stop on any future fraudulent charges being submitted by Uber.\n",
      "I recently had two incidents that shaped my many reason not to spend any more money with Uber. In New York, Uber is more popular among the natives than taking a train. Which is great, when dealing with the harsh winter. The issue is the service coming from the Uber drivers and Uber's customer service. Most recently I took a Uber ride to Far Rockaway, NY to Queens, NY which was a $50 dollar Uber pool. The car was very cold and in the beginning the Uber driver was very quiet. Once we got closer the destination the Uber driver began to get confused on what route to take. As I asked to make a right at the next light he turned around while driving and began to yell at me. We were on a parkway in Far Rockaway with cars driving all around us. He began to shout and hits brake twice jerking me from out of the seat. He begins to curse me out and tell me to shut up until we get there or he will make walk. \n",
      "Upon arriving at my home, I was struck in the face by the driver. This assault was unprovoked! He also threw my glasses down the street and they were run over. I have been contacting Uber for 5 days now and still have no results or restitution.\n",
      "Uber doesn't give a ** about safety. A reckless negligent Uber Eats courier on a bike cause a collision with my car causing damage. Uber doesn't seem to really care. Their biker's negligence jeopardized the safety of all others drivers, pedestrians and other bikers. Have police report as evidence.\n",
      "I just received an odd snail mail supposedly from Uber, there's only one problem: I never used Uber, either as a driver or a rider. It came from a \"Return Mail Processing\", which runs out of a PO box in Claysburg, PA, and suggests I sign up with \"experianidworks.com\", which itself appears to be a known fraudulent site. If you receive a letter like this, beware. The website wants your SS number, everything.\n",
      "I had a horrible experience with the Uber drivers in Miami, the communication/language barriers were awful. I get home from my trip and am charged an unknown $40 fee. Turns out, I left a mess in the back seat of someone's car. This was incredibly inaccurate and I was sent these pics, which were nothing short of a normal backseats appearance. Whatever I was looking at wasn't in my opinion a mess over $1. Very upsetting.\n",
      "I am an Uber driver and have been doing it for the past year. Anyone who surpasses 25 Uber requests can cash out the same day, which is called Instant Pay. Lately I have been trying to cash out after working for them, and it doesn't give me an option. I spoke with 2 different supervisors with whom they tell me there is a lot of deliveries paid for through Uber Promotions and caused a red flag on my account preventing me from cashing out money I have earned. The first supervisor advised me to try taking a few rides instead of deliveries, and that should fix the issue and my money will be available the next day. I followed his advice and the next day I was able to cash out. \n",
      "I have four charges on my account via a debit card that I use maybe 3 times a month. These charges were for services in California while I live all the way across the country and was thousands of miles away from California at the time of the \"service.\" Not only that, but there are charges for Uber Eats all other the place and they don't even come close to serving my area.\n",
      "After my account was hacked and rides from England were charged to my credit card I decided to cancel my UBER account. UBER refuses to send me a check for an amount of money credited to my account. They claim that they do not issue checks. I had to cancel my credit card because of their customer database was hacked. They never notified their customers that the database was hacked!!! The amount of money they owe me is irrelevant, it is the principle of the matter.\n",
      "Decided to give Uber a try so loaded their app. My first \"trip\" was to return home after dropping my car off at dealer. Evening before I spent 20 minutes setting up my account and unsuccessfully setting my first trip. The next morning it took another frustrating 15 minutes to make the app understand that I wasn't traveling FROM home but TO home. Such an easy and logical event but the idiot app designers at Uber can't see that as an option. I finally left home with anticipation of using Uber for the first time. At the dealer I waited for 45 minutes for an Uber ride that never showed. Took a cab home and on the way got two messages from Uber, the first obviously from another customer asking \"are you coming\" and the second telling me there were no Uber cars available... this in Denver! Have since deleted the app.\n",
      "Like the drivers and ease of hailing  a ride;  also app is pretty good as long as everything is going well.  HOWEVER, in Nov and Dec of 2017 my account was hacked and fraudulent rides were clocked in in LONDON and PARIS while I was in the USA.  First time it was 4 rides; last time it was 9 rides and it all added up quickly.  Two of my CC were used in the process, necessitating my CC Company to shut down one of my main credit cards... what a hassle to deal with all that.  Customer Service (once you got it) was great as they did reverse charges (so the only folks out of the money I would assume would be the drivers, unless Uber picked up the Fraud Tab).  But Uber did charge me a ''fee'' for reversing charges, so I did not walk away completely un-bruised.  I promptly SHUT DOWN my account and will find another Ride-Share service that is more secure.Uber has got some issues to work out... their CULTURE as recent news reports allude to but also a BETTER way (faster and easier) to alert corporate about big problems with the app and web site and FRAUD, etc.  The system as it is now is elusive and painstakingly complex.4 Stars for the SERVICE & Riders;  1 Star for the Hacking = 2 stars total as my review/ranking.JP\n",
      "I happened to book an uber ride, driver accepted the ride. Even after 15 mins i din't see car moving around. I tried calling the driver, he didn't respond. I messaged on uber app, mentioning the address and asking him if he is going to pick me up? Driver cancelled after 5 mins or so!!! i was stranded with no where to go!!! this is ridiculous. Again uber charged me cancellation charges when driver cancelled the ride? This driver has 5* rating!!! When i reached uber customer service asking me to compensate as i have wasted 30 mins bcos of driver, uber says \" Its ur problem and drivers, we can't take any responsibility for driver actions!!\" _x000D_Why customers are charged cancellation charges when we cancel even after 2 mins, here driver cancelled after 15 mins!!! _x000D_Uber is a ridiculous company which is misusing customer data and leveraging the loop holes!!_x000D_Uber should be banned in US and every customer whose personal info is leaked should be paid compensation!!  Uber tracks every movement and claims its to improve trip experience!!_x000D_My suggestion is first do a proper driver orientation and back verification, which will definitely improve customer experience!!! _x000D_Notice that if anyone has lyft and uber, uber price is lower, but if ur using uber alone they hike the price.... they do a predatory pricing!!!\n",
      "Got new phone. Trying to get app on new phone. Says account already exist. Call support no number, number on website 1300. Something fake. Says tap Uber icon on app, cant get new app installed. Never rode yet but had old account hooked up to PayPal for emergency. Tried to find support email. None I can find. No humans live here.\n",
      "This morning, I had three charges from the UK (Uber Eats). I receive notifications about purchases per charge, as I was also involved in the Equifax breach. I'm assuming that my Uber account was hacked, as three orders were placed, and my credit card information is saved. I even got a call from a +44 country code, which is the UK, asking where I was and how to deliver my food. To top it off, my card was expired, yet Uber still authorized the charges. I canceled my card with Capital One and wrote two separate emails to Uber. I have YET to receive a response, which is pretty terrible - especially considering the breach that they neglected to tell everyone about not long ago. I like Uber, but will seriously be considering whether I want to trust Uber with my information.\n",
      "I was ordering the Uber for my dad who doesn't speak English well. Uber notified me that I wasn't a rider, so I added my dad as a rider, and didn't realize that there is NO way to contact the driver once you add a rider. This was very confusing. I called the driver right away and could not give her ample directions to get to my dad. She drove around for 5 minutes without me being able to give her directions and my dad could not give her directions, and I got slapped with a cancellation fee. Please fix this issue or be sure to clarify to people order the Uber that they cannot contact the driver if they add another rider.\n",
      "Uber drivers need to retake their driving test because they can't can't drive. You guys get confused with directions too much. Uberpool rips off customers to make the most bang for there buck. I was literally late for work cuz we had to pick up some bozo in the opposite direction. And UberEats some B!@#$ ate my apple pie I ordered. Im not gonna go into details about that tho! Boycott Uber\n",

      "TLDR: Uber driver made stop for me, left with my stuff, charged me more and more, never came back and cancelled my trip after 10 minutes. -To Start: DO NOT EVER ADD STOPS. I have used Uber all over the world and asked drivers to make stops many times. This week was the last time. Story: Seattle WA USA. I had a great dinner after shopping and was in downtown Seattle. I requested an UBER, waited for the driver, who had a hard time finding the location I was at, although very easy to find. After he picked me up I asked him to stop by a store so I could grab some water before arriving at my destination. He agreed.\n",
      "I recently took an Uber with a friend from an event back to my apartment (both in San Francisco). She called the Uber for us, and upon exiting the car I quickly realized I left my purse (including my wallet with my driver's license, credit card, debit card, etc.) in the backseat of the car. The only way you are able to get in contact with anyone is through the app, and only my friend can contact the driver as it was through her account. It has now been over 24 hours since the ride and attempting to contact the driver and I have not been able to get in contact with the driver nor any kind of representative from Uber (as there is no general number to call to speak with a representative). Extremely angry and will not be using Uber again.\n",
      "When I first started using them they would quote 10 to $11 in the trip. Usually cost 10 to $11. Now the same quote and the trip is costing 15 to $18 because drivers are adding on charges that are frivolous and unethical. I have twice been charged wait times when there was no wait times. The added fees are growing. This company does not operate above board. They have no checks or balances in place. Looking for alternatives Uber.\n",
      "On November 17th 2017 I requested a Uber ride at 5:20am. Had to be at work at 6 o'clock. Am a half hour ride. The driver got to me at 5:45 am and after a 20 min. Debate with the driver of where I live at and work. Needless to say I arrived at work late. After I reported the driver to the company they promised to refund me my money back. To this day have not seen it.\n",
      "I have been working with Uber for over 2 years in. On September 14th my account was turned off and they began a yearly background check. The date is now December 2nd and my background check is still not complete. Uber is using the company Checkr and they state that background checks normally Take 5 to 7 days. In just a couple of weeks it'll be 90 days. My background check last year took 3 hours and it was completed. \n",
      "I ordered a pick up from airport to a gas station to meet my companion who drives trucks over the road. The driver took route that is not normally taken, but I knew the route. I do this weekly and knew the rates and routes. He didn't speak and it was a quiet ride. I got toy destination thanked him and got out. I normally get a response to rate and tip driver as soon as I get out. This time I didn't so screenshot my rate and info. I got it almost 20 mins later and it was double my original rate because he charged me for his return trip to the same airport. I contacted the number listed next to bank charge only to be told to go thru the Help on the app and then phone disconnected.\n",
      "Landed at LAX and at curve at 3:10PM 11/18/2017 and called on Uber (TM) for an economy ride a little under $12 for a 3.5 mile run to work. Watched the car coming on it when it suddenly cancelled and I had to start over at 3:18PM, only this time the fee was going to be $14+ dollars. I had to take a call, and by 3:35PM it was up to $24, but they didn't show the price, I just got the 2.5x normal rate. I could have taken a taxi for $19. And the Airport wasn't that crowded. Parking for a 3 day trip would have been the same cost.\n",
      "I arrived at the San Antonio airport and checked for an Uber. It stated $12.21, however, my luggage has not come out yet so I waited to confirm. When I received my luggage I checked again and the price jumped to $21.12. The caption stated price increase due to demand. To me that's price gouging. I will never use Uber again.\n",
      "I live in Springfield MA. It used to cost $6.50 one way to go 5 minutes away. Now it's $10.50 one way! That's a drastic increase! I only used them infrequently as I'm receiving disability and have financial hardship. Now I can't afford them at all! As a former dental hygienist, in my opinion this is unethical and unprofessional business practices.\n",
      "I accidentally posted the wrong address. I tried to tell the driver the was incorrect. He would not listen. He kept driving in the wrong direction for several miles. The trip was a twice the amount for the same trip I took early. I guess with Uber the customer is not always right. The driver padded the fare by not listening.\n",
      "Sadly I have not had very good service in Edmonton by Uber in the last few months. I have been sworn at by drivers, insulted by drivers, had advances made toward me by drivers, and more. Most drivers refused to come into my condo complex because the GPS shows my address as in the middle of the road. If I pin the address as suggested on their website they go to the wrong address and then cancel the trip. I regularly get double charged and have to request a refund. Also I have been noticing that in the last few weeks I have be quoted a rate, charge the rate, then refunded that rate, and charged a higher rate every trip. The saddest part of all is that in Edmonton Uber is the safest way to travel outside of the bus. I wouldn't get into a cab in this city ever and now I don't ever want to get into an Uber. I have contact Uber about my issues as well and been threatened multiple times. Uber is all about $$. They could care less about their customers.\n",
      "All I can say is if you enjoy being yelled at, sword at, insulted, threatened, having advances made at you, spending 20 min to make 5 min trip because the driver has zero navigational skills, have to rebook your trip several times because drivers keep cancelling, being over charged and double charged then Uber is the ride company for you. I would rather freeze walking to work in -30C weather than get into another Uber.\n",
      "I am sad and angry, I have bad experience with Uber before but this time has been the worse! I left my Quinny Buzz Xtra on the Uber last Sunday and I called several times to the driver but he never answer any of my calls, two days after he finally text me back about the items left on the vehicle and he told me that he is not the owner of the car, that he gave it back to the owner on Monday at 6 pm. That my stroller was probably there, so I request to call the owner of the car in that case and he said he didn't have a number to reach the guy. \n",
      "On 11/12 I was trying get answer why my account was charged twice from ride on 11/11. However my question was never answer (within 4th separate messages) each time I have received the same respond (automatically respond) that was unclear and not on topic. On 11/11 my account was charged in amount of $14.13 and $1 for tip and on 11/12 my account was charged again in amount of $14.64. When I asked why my account was charged twice, customer service explanation for addition \"waiting fees\" charge which is 2 mins. Which is unclear why I was charged twice in amount of $14. My experience with Uber customer service was frustrated and unsatisfied.\n",
      "We had a 15 minute ride from friend's house around 11pm, nothing out of the ordinary. In the morning, driver send us a $150 fee for cleaning along with pictures of vomit??? RIDICULOUS!!! Why don't they charge the person that actually did it??? So frustrating to deal with it now.\n",
      "I like the convenience of Uber, and have been a loyal customer for a long time. HOWEVER, when TWO of their drivers cancel on me within minutes, and then the PRICE GOES UP for the next one... I'm not a happy camper. I used to refer all of my friends to this service, especially the ones using Lyft.... Not any longer. $#*! this service, their drivers that were disrespectful on the phone with me... My business and my friends' business will go elsewhere. Thanks Uber, for your killings, lack of customer service, entitlement and garbage program. Byyyyyeeeeeeeeeeee.\n",
      "Out of desperation, I signed up for Uber for an appointment. Registration was easy, and the app kept me informed about the time of arrival, which was FAST. A driver happened to be in my area and came right away. I was texted a photo and his ID by Uber, so I was reassured - but I did forward it to a family member as a security precaution. The driver was SO kind - congenial and eager to please. It was such a great introduction to Uber and I have been happy ever since.\n",
      "I had just completed running the New York Marathon and had requested an Uber Pool ride back to my hotel. First, let me tell you what started out right: The driver agreed to the pick up and drop off locations via the app. I then called and spoke with the driver to let him know that the pick up location was actually blocked off due to the marathon, and we agreed on another pickup location 1 block away before the race road block. Before I was picked up, I got a notification that another rider would be joining for part of my ride. I was picked up by the driver at the spoken agreed upon location; shortly the 2nd passenger was picked up and dropped off. Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.\n",
      "Iam really disappointed with uber charges!! For the last 2 months have been calling uber in different routes but unfortunately when I agree with charges uber declares for a journey in the end I get a higher charge of $3-$5 without any explanation!! Only todays trip where I had limited funds on the account my charges had no issue!!! This is cheating!!!\n",
      "My appointment time for auto repairs required a drop-off early am for it to be there and available for a mechanic to begin the work. The Uber app was easily installed on my mobile device and was followed with the required information being filled onto the blanks. When typing a phone number, it gave an order to check SMS texts for a confirmation code to be used along with the number. No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Uber headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. As follows; I suggest someone there unclog your ride summoning impacted website rectum by swallowing an online laxative, followed by a readily available Fleets enema from a pharmacy.\n",
      "In fact, lately I haven't used any other service because Uber is just so effective and affordable, especially when going out socially, because drinking and driving is not an option.\n",
      "Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives.\n",
      "Uber is a big fraud.. They charged me with double money.. My money was cut from pytm also  and my driver also asked for the money.. For the same there was no positive response from the uber customer care ...dont try it... It is a big cheater..\n",
      "Why is it so hard for you to understand that if I am trying to retrieve Uber cab, with the same email just a different phone number that it is me? If you say it is for security and you don't recognize the phone number, then your security system is **. Because therefore if it was any good, your security system would link my original number to my new number which is under the same account and recognize that it is me. So stop rejecting my new number. What do you think I want everyone calling me on my private or personal number. Do not respond to this until you have fixed your problems. Or IT will only tell \"you people\" TO SHUT THE ** UP. And now I just tried to send this and you would not let me go past too. Why would I put any amount of stars when you serviced me zero amount of stars.\n",
      "I was in South Beach, FL. I was staying at a major hotel and ordered an Uber. The driver could not find me which was ridiculous. I was waiting out front of the hotel which was located on the main drag of SOBE. He hung up on me and charged me $5. I disputed the charge so now I have a credit on my account. Uber isn't available where I live. The last time I ordered a car in South Beach the driver hardly spoke English and couldn't find TJ MAXX. My advice... don't use Uber in Florida.\n",
      "I had damage to my vehicle due to a Uber driver my upstairs neighbor used. The trim from the rear wheel well was broke off. The driver didn't leave a note. He kept calling my neighbor. Now he will not answer his phone. Can't get a number for Uber to locate the driver.\n",
      "Uber has made travel so much simpler for me. I use it to get to and from the airport, or to get to stores in unfamiliar areas and sometimes to get to events or a party where I don't want to drive or find parking.\n",
      "I use Uber fairly frequently. Overall it has been a good service. I've had amazing drivers. You cannot call them. Only go through some steps to send them messages. I want to just call them if I have an issue. It's so frustrating. However, two things have happened in a short time that will make me be very wary in using Uber in the future. Might just go back to taking cabs.\n",
      "Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's \"dynamic pricing\" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.\n",
      "Did you notice that every time you call Uber to complain or ask or do anything over the phone that they intentionally talk slow and always doing some checking in the background and usually the phone call last anywhere between 30 minutes to hour and a half. My phone call was 1 hour and 36 minutes. I have the file phone call recorded. This is not the first time I noticed that the payments are not correct but it is the first time I decided to stand up and call them on it.\n",
      "I was a pretty loyal Uber customer until my last trip.  I open the app and the only three options are 1) wheel chair accessible, 2) uber cab and 3) Spanish. 1) I 100% feel for all handicapped and accept that there are options for them. I think it's great. Should it be the first option? No. Should there be a setting on the app that says the car needs to be handicapped accessible? Yes. 2) Why on earth would I call a taxi when I'm particularly calling uber to AVOID taxis????? The cost of uber cab makes absolutely zero point in calling an uber. It's more expensive! 3) Why in the $#*! do we have a Spanish option when we are in an English speaking country? There wasn't an English option when I was in Croatia using Uber recently. Nor did I expect it. $#*! UBER I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.\n",
      "My last 2 experiences with Uber have made me use taxis which turned out to be preferable to Uber. Two weeks ago called for an Uber and my driver did not speak or understand English so I immediately got out and was still charged on Tuesday. October 24th I requested an Uber to take me to midway airport. When I received notification that my driver had arrived--I called since I was already waiting outside. He informed me that he was in Lombard. And here I was at the place I am always picked up in Chicago. Guess I am on to Lyft.\n",
      "Our party of 6 consisted of three of my adult daughters and two friends going wedding dress shopping. We needed an SUV to accommodate all of us, and Uber showed a driver 20 minutes away in Sanford, Florida. Perfect, we thought as the reservation wasn't for another 40 minutes. We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment. There must be a way for Uber to assure that your card is being used for YOUR trip and not for someone else.\n",
      "75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had \"Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No\" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.\n",
      "I would file a class action suit against Uber. I do not use this service and get billed! My card was taken and used. This company is not checking identification to match cards used for service purchases. This company and/or drivers are allowing minors to ride without permission and are using unauthorized debit & credit cards. There is no direct contact number to resolve these issues unless you create an Uber account. Has this happened to anyone else?\n",
      "If I could give 0 stars I would. Uber has STOLE my MONEY and has made 3 unauthorized charges to my credit card. On top of that, they are not even taking responsibility for it and continuously keep marking my issue as resolved even though I have proof such as my bank statements. There is no phone number or place I could go therefore they are taking advantage of that. There are random charges on my credit card that total to over $30 and I did not use my Uber app for a few weeks. When I asked them to explain those charges they say they don't know and just ignore me and mark it as resolved. \n",
      "I had driven to KCVG to leave a rental car. Having used Uber oh let say a half dozen time in my life. I charge up my phone that had gone dead. Now at the Avis rental car return the system informed me to drive over to the terminal. This is after the Avis agent informs me \"Oh yes. Uber picks up here.\" I follow the instructions Uber gave. I take the shuttle to terminal and do not summon ride until at pickup site. Here is the hurtful thing... Now I could be wrong. While I am looking at the drive from Lyft I get this call from the Uber driver... \"I am outside...\" the way the exchange starts.\n",
      "I used many times UBER rides in USA. I Visited Delhi India two weeks ago and had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment. I thought maybe my credit card was not working here so I paid him cash, later I found out my credit card was also charged. When I requested the refund from Uber they give me excuses by automated reply like it's my fault I would have not given cash to Driver. What I supposed to do when driver is insisting to pay cash after completion of ride. At that time there was no way so I could confirm from UBER office before paying. Uber sent automated emails saying wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. SO NO MORE UBER.\n",
      "My last two experiences with Uber were not too great. The car that picked me up was old, dirty and nasty with dog hair everywhere and the air conditioner didn't work. It was 90+ degrees out and we had to ride with the windows down. The experience was a ride to the airport and that was frantic. The man had only been in my town for a few weeks and he was confused on how to get to the airport. I don't think Uber is checking on who's driving and in what vehicles.\n",
      "Uber is frud , uber driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue_x000D_My suggestion is don't go With uber. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater\n",
      "It's unfortunate to know that Uber allows its drivers to rate clients. My rating with Uber was 4.86 and after a recent trip out of town and used Uber my rating dropped to 4.63. I was kind and friendly to the driver. I engaged in the conversation that he started, I also sent him an additional tip post my trip. I will no longer ride with Uber and leave a driver who may be unhappy in his or her job or having a bad day or expecting a cash tip to rate me as a client and passenger. I treat all people with kindness and respect and my driver ratings have always been very good to excellent. You have lost a loyal customer.\n",
      "DO NOT ACCEPT RIDE WITH UBER DRIVER \"EDGAR\" IN SILVER TOYOTA SIENNA VAN!!! Me, my husband, and six year old daughter requested an Uber to take us back to the Sanford International Airport Wednesday, October 25th from Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We had a great experience with our trip to the resort the Wednesday prior with Mike who drove a grey Lexus. That fare totaled $40.49 and we tipped him $10. That said, we requested another Uber X for our trip returning to the Sanford airport with the same expected $40 fare - this was the fare provided when we accepted ride.\n",
      "Well for starters!! I totally disagree with this star system they utilize, it is insane!! Getting to the point, of my dissatisfaction, after going through all that one has to do in order to become a driver for this Uber mess, number 1 - I don't agree with this off the wall system they call the STAR system, it's insane you work your butt off, but and your steadily being badgered by these ignorant Agents threatening to shut you down... For what I'd been subject to while driving for this ludacris company, for whoever these idiots are that intercept these Emails, from, some of these crazy riders!! It gets totally nerve wrecking!! Put up with this nonsense!!! \n",
      "I purchased a 100.00 dollar Uber gift card from CVS. After downloading uber app adding gift card on my android phone, I get an error message payment error. I've been trying to contact Uber for over 2 days and getting nothing but automated response from their so called customer service \"help\". After a useless message they have the nerve to send email \"issue resolved\". I'm out of 100.00 dollars. I even went to Facebook attempting to get a resolution same automated response!!! I HOPE THESE FRAUDS GO OUT OF BUSINESS FOR STEALING 100.00 DOLLARS FROM ME!!! No company is too big to fall!! I regret ever considering using Uber. Lesson learned.\n",
      "We used Uber about 10 times over a week on an Orlando vacation instead of renting a car and had very good results except for the last trip from our hotel to the airport. The initial estimated cost was $21.86 and it ended up taking 20 minutes or so. At the airport we were shocked that we had paid $65.91 and the receipt showed a distance of 74 miles, a trip time of 53 minutes and the map of the route was different from the one that we had taken! We contacted Uber and they promptly refunded the extra cost. Very bizarre - I hope this is an isolated incident and that Uber investigates. If the fare wasn't so much higher than expected we may not have noticed.\n",
      "I WAS a very loyal Uber customer in the past, especially when I lost my car so I used Uber on a daily basis coming to and from work. Well today I needed a quick ride to get a quick bite (husband was using my car) so I decided, â€œHey why not use Uber.â€ I had heard they jacked up the prices but I never imagined I'd pay 50$ for a 7:00-minute drive. Yes my bill was 46$! THAT IS RIDICULOUS! Never will I use this company again. They are just ripping people off at this point.\n",
      "I received e-mails from Uber asking me why I do not take Uber anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails.1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Uber. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Uber. I tried to call Uber when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: \"Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox\". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Uber has plenty of.2. Uber VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Uber and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Uber phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem.That's a big flaw. I called Uber automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Uber website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Uber poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Uber has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Uber because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Uber has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Uber cars, or banged up Uber cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems._x000D_In contrast, Lyft has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness.4. I do not care about the negative press that Uber has had. However, I do care very much about:_x000D_- the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL_x000D_- the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS._x000D_- your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though uber DOES send email to you. Until Uber solves these problems, I will no longer take Uber cars. I will go to Lyft and other competitors, every time.\n",
      "On Oct. 8, 2017 at 1:12:45 PM - There should be No charge for this ride. Despite using a GPS, this driver tried to take a closed entrance to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and then had to detour back to the original entrance Once in Manhattan. And 10 blocks from our theater destination he took another wrong turn and ended up in New Jersey. By the time he got back to Manhattan it was already past the starting time of the play we were going to. As a matter of fact it was already 30 minutes into the play.\n",
      "I requested a ride from my residence to Publix grocery store, $8.48 and $5 tip. When finished shopping, I found my phone was not in my pocket. Upon exiting, the driver was outside with my phone. I had dropped it in her car and she returned it. I was very grateful. Return home was $7.15 and $5 tip (a different driver). Checked my bank account when I got home, was charged total of $48.84. Registered concern in the app. There is no customer service phone number. I was sent a message that I was charged $15 for returning my phone. Still a discrepancy. I replied and my concerned was totally dismissed. Message said complaint was resolved. Terrible service. No more Uber for me.\n",
      "I had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment and I obliged since Uber has a refund option for such circumstances but when I requested the refund they give me excuses like it's my fault for not checking the payment method, etc. If that was the case, they wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. This is the second time Uber has done this to me and it is the only reason why I'm lodging a complaint here.\n",
      "While it is wonderful to be able to get a driver with a \"tap\" of your finger, there is much more behind the ease of the process. I was a driver or a \"partner\" as UBER likes to call us. I drove for UBER for approximately 3 years without incident. However, their support throughout the three years is nothing I have ever experienced. It's predominantly offshore and only app driven. You cannot speak to anyone and the support \"messages\" or solutions are all canned or templates. There is no humanity for \"outside the box\" incidents. I recently had an incident on the freeway while I had a rider in the car. A motorcycle was \"lane splitting\" (in California) and deliberately punched my drivers' side mirror. When I reported this to UBER, they deactivated me and cited I was an unsafe driver. Again, I never had any other reports.\n",
      "This is a complaint about a trip on 28.9.17 ordered at 8.25 a.m. Eastern time in Boston. The expected arrival time delayed a lot, 3 min, 6 min, 9 min, 4 min and so on. Then after approx 12 minutes a message came that Driver ** has cancelled the trip! For reference: the surcharge when booing was factor 1.4. Then my host Jennifer booked for me, meanwhile the surcharge was 2.4. I finally arrived with much delay at the railway station. The driver just cancelled since he expected more profitable trips to perform during that time. This practice was confirmed by another Uber driver in Boston when I openly talked with him. On top of all they charged me 5 USD for cancellation. I did not cancel. Finally Uber paid me back only the 5 USD cancellation fee, they did not refund me the approx 15 USD loss being the difference between factor 1.4 and 2.4.\n",
      "Uber drivers in Sydney (and other cities around the world ) have a bad habit of accepting jobs from miles away and sometimes up to 20mins, while still dropping off a passenger and while there are dozens of cars very close to the new job location. I had one this morning again to take me from home in Rushcutters Bay to work in the city and there were at least 6 cars within 1-2mins from my location. This the ** Uber driver, still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away. Uber needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry, if customers want ** service they would take a cab. The solution could be very simple, offer a function on the app for the users to manage a circular area around the pickup zone beyond which Uber drivers are excluded from picking up rides. Simple!!\n",
      "It was completely outrageous when I called Uber to pick me up at the airport and bring me back home. They gave me the same service from my home to the airport three days prior to my arrival in town. To my surprise they charge me $58 for the same travel time and distance that I paid $23 before. The same service, the same distance, the same location. Never again request other services and never again will request their services.\n",
      "I use Uber all the time, but I am officially done with this unprofessional company. Guess it would be a crime to be able to talk to someone in person at Uber. Uber is letting their drivers ripoff their riders. I have a service dog and in the last weeks have been charged twice a cleaning fee, without any input. The last one was for dirt spots on the seat that was already there. I am tired of drivers making extra money, whenever they feel like it. I am done being ripped off!!!\n",
      "** - Contact number of the driver. Absolutely not professional. I booked a cab and it showed me 3 minutes away. Again it changed to 6 minutes away. Followed by 9 minutes away. I called him to guide him through. He purposely kept the phone on speaker and pretended like he could not hear me. Uber has really disappointed me. HORRIBLE.\n",
      "The navigation system is great but in India the driver selection is not good, if there are any issues with bills or rates or promos the customer care does not respond quickly.\n",
      "If you are in the Philadelphia area and your uber driver is Daemon, cancel it real quick. When she picked me up she was at the wrong address so I had to literally walk a 1/2 block to her car and when she called me to ask where I was at, she was rude, even though she was at the wrong house!Her car smelled very bad (musty and dirty clothes) and it was dirty! She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work.When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building. She is by far the worst uber driver and I have had some bad drivers but she is flat out terrible.\n",
      "Uber rides have always been convenient, plentiful and prompt. All rides have been with good and friendly drivers. Always been impressed with the cleanliness and newness of the vehicles I've ridden in.\n",
      "I was late for my work and appointment because driver's cancelled it for no reason, my place is easy to find so I wondered why they kept cancelling my trip. I had cancelled many times...it's not funny anymore \" Uber\" . I am almost done with you \"uber\". This company Sucks! I've been nice to all your drivers even if sometimes some of the uber driver's stinks I was still polite towards him. Now I download Lyft and will try it. Thank-you Uber!!!\n",
      "Uber Atlanta Horrible - I did Rideshare. The driver confused me with the other person that took the ride. I requested to be picked up from the Aquarium and go to Mary Mac's Restaurant. If you look at where the driver took the client it was not to that place. Uber charged me $4.77 for a ride I never took and believed the driver over me. Rideshare should not be used If you can't account for who took the ride. I was never picked up, the driver simply confused me with the other person. I had 3 rides scheduled but only picked up one time. Unfortunately, because of their growth, there's no way to account for what is real and not. I had the same problem in Washington D.C. but was able to get refunded.\n",
      "I have had a positive experience with Uber and it's the company that I contact when I need fast service. When it mattered they were there and always on time and I am thankful for that.\n",
      "Found myself in California, emergency trip, without transportation. Stranger in town. Called taxi for 16 mile trip to the hospital. Cost $58.00 and no way to afford that for long after paying for food and lodging. Called Uber after that. Less than half the cost and drivers always prompt, courteous, and helpful in recommending food, shopping and other necessities when asked. Got a mini sightseeing tour with every ride as they explained the surrounding area. Loved it. Thank you Uber.\n",
      "I'm an avid Uber rider. On 9/30/2017, I ordered an Uber pool around 2pm. My fare was $8.98. The driver picked me up from my location. On the way to my dropoff, the driver picked up another passenger, dropped that passenger off. He proceeded to my dropoff, but he ended my ride by mistake. The driver had to load my dropoff address again. It's only after I got out the car, I realized my fare was duplicated. I've sent emails to UBER. They dont have customer relations, only email. They didnt refund me my money. On October 6, I used their service again. This time my fare was $30.92. This fare was obviously deducted from my Visa card and its also on my statement. On their app, UBER is claiming I have an outstanding payment, but I have PAID THEM. I need help.\n",
      "Uber charged me again for a wait time when I was outside waiting for the driver to pull up. Today I watched the driver pull up and got into the car. I even texted the driver my location beforehand so there would be no confusion. Then I look at my online receipt and I see the charge. This is the third time Uber has done this. I think it is a scam. I rated the driver really low and will change it once someone verifies that the drivers aren't responsible for this. I can't get anybody on the phone. Uber's customer service is atrocious. I can't keep using a service that tries to scam me at every opportunity.\n",
      "I've had limited but really optimal experiences. I only use the service occasionally like three times in the last two years, but nice cars, good people, short wait, very low prices.\n",
      "I am an Uber driver and have been only for a short time but all the passengers have said positive things about their rides. The company checks out all the riders before they are allowed to use Uber. It also does a background check of the drivers. They send the driving directions on where to pickup the passengers and also for the destination. Then pay me once a week.\n",
      "Love Uber. First time user but was very impressed of the reasonable price and efficient service. The driver was very nice and helpful too. I would have given a five star but we had to go to a certain station to catch our ride not at the curbside by the baggage claim area.\n",
      "Uber accepted a prebooking for a 5 a.m. pick up to the airport with a quote of $32 base price plus taxes. An e mail stating that surge pricing was in effect was sent just as the driver arrived. We were already in the street. There was no time to cancel and book a limo so we got in. As a result, our fare was augmented to $126. I complained and they reduced it to $114. I am still fighting for a fair settlement . Today I took a cab.\n",
      "Worst experience of contacting Uber customer care. I left a sunglass and called within minutes of dropping, however they failed to connect the driver immediately and later sends an email saying they didnot find anything. This is ridiculous and highly unethical.\n",
      "In fairness these 2 don't play fair. Yes, fairness is important to many of us. Their ID is sketchy, no car safety checks and they don't pay taxes and fees that taxis do.\n",
      "My car was in the repair shop and I needed a ride home from work. I used my Uber app and my driver was there within 15 minutes and she was very professional. Her name was Joke and I said I would use her services again. Great experience!\n",
      "I order Uber pick up and my family and I find out every each time my phone has higher charges. Other 2 phones only charge around $5.77 for a pool ride, my phone every each time is higher, it charge $7.49, usually a dollar something higher, sometimes is even more.\n",
      "We had occasion to use Uber for the first time in Washington. D.C. last fall. The service was convenient, dependable, economical and very easy to use. The service was friendly and on time, the drivers courteous. A very good experience.\n",
      "My son and daughter recently went to a concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn New York. For convenience my son ordered an Uber. The quoted fare was $57-$80.00. He was charged $81.52. After the concert he requested another Uber for the return home to New Jersey. He was quoted the cost would be $55-$75.00. When he left the car the final cost for the ride was suppose to be $75.22.\n",
      "Uber has suddenly blocked my account without giving any justification. Even their customer care is not giving any proper reason. I have requested for reason but that can't even give that. This is not ethical to block without any reason.\n",
      "I have the Uber app installed on my phone. Uber drivers are easy to schedule, payment is made online so I never need to worry about having cash. My wait is typically 5 minutes and I'm able to see the car in route along with make and license plate numbers (which can be sent to a friend by text if anything should ever happen). Fares are 50-75% less than traditional cabs. Cars are clean and well maintained. Love Uber!\n",
      "New User. Tried to book a future pickup and thought we had. Realized that they dispatched a driver immediately and once I discovered this I cancelled. They charged $5 fee and I disputed because of their poor app information. There is no phone number to discuss customer relations. I will NEVER use this company!\n",
      "The Uber driver cancelled the trip himself without consulting me. I was waiting for the driver to pick me up. While I was waiting, I received the email that the trip is cancelled and I was charged R25. I struggled to get hold of them to solve the problem, because everything is online with them. I managed to submit my complaint with them online. They took about two hours to come back. A Mr ** told me I must check that the reverse the money back into my account, which is not true. They only reverse the amount which they would've charged me for the trip but not the cancellation fees. I sent Mr ** an email again and told him that I was not reimbursed with the cancellation fees. He replied to me with an attitude in bold that the driver must get paid for a cancelled trip and at the same time the attitude is \"what do you further want us to do. The matter is resolved and like leave it and keep quiet.\" \n",
      "Uber's customer support via email is beyond words. The most horrible and worthless support group I have ever seen. These people don't read the cases, and subsequent replies are bizarre and repeat the previous CS rep reply. You will never have the same support rep even for the same case so there is no accountability or structure. It's quite unbelievable on all levels on how bad it is. At least as a writer you can dispute a credit card charge. But as a driver Uber can cheat you out of money and get away with it. I am a victim.\n",
      "Uber came home faster for pick me up, the driver was a courteous and wait for me more than 4 minutes without charge me. The driver use a precaution and respect the speed limit. He has a good Education and He known a lot of World History. I compare the total price and I save like 50%, because regular taxi are expensive. I recommend Uber, peace of mind.\n",
      "I noticed that when I Googled Uber, they were giving free rides to new customers so I downloaded the app and attempted to add a payment method. I'm disabled therefore I receive my money on a prepaid (if you will) government debit card. The card is issued through the Bank of America from the government of the United States and Uber will not allow it as a form of payment, nor will they allow me to use my PayPal account which is attached to said debit card. I find this extremely prejudicial towards the disabled sect, as many of us cannot drive or even afford a car, making ride sharing a necessity. I've spoken to Uber drivers who find the map app to be incorrect quite often, getting them lost and making them late. They also find the politics of the company deplorable. \n",
      "I had four trip to the same distances with four different fares!! Uber charged me more than the fare showed up in my phone! I have tried a lot to contact them to resolve the problem, at the end, they said it's more than 7 days and they cannot solve this problem!!! There is no phone number to contact and I am very upset with what they charged my credit card. I will never use this service again. Shame on Uber.\n",
      "I use Uber daily to commute back and forth to work. The drivers are reliable, and I don't have to deal with cash transactions anymore. The last time I used a \"cab,\" the driver ripped me off! Thank God for Uber!\n",
      "I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why:_x000D_Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to \"shut up\" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later._x000D_First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision._x000D_Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth\n",
      "I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Uber tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches).  I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them.  Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience.  When notified of their failings, Uber curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience.  Really, that's your best?\n",
      "In general Uber is a great app, easy to use, convenient. When it becomes a not so great app is the \"surge prices\" feature. The ride then costs a ridiculous amount. I agree you can charge more when there's high demand but there should be a limit, like 20% more or 30% more. But often times it could be 3X as much. Makes regular customers like me resentful.\n",
      "I've used Uber many times in CA and in MD. The app could be a bit more user friendly though. With the exception of one, all drivers have been friendly and have driven carefully. One time I had an issue with billing and customer service handled the problem immediately and to my satisfaction. I would definitely recommend Uber.\n",
      "They have the most jacked payment arrangements. They are willing to accept garbage such as Apple, Android, or gift cards to pay, but won't accept prepaid cards or American Express or Discover (mind you all of them you add money to). Use Lyft because they offer great discounts and they are more flexible & customer friendly. They truly want your business.\n",
      "We used Uber in NYC recently and it was our first experience with the service. Almost all of our drivers over three days were prompt, courteous, and treated us with respect. I don't envy these guys' job, but we certainly appreciated them.\n",
      "This was very convenient and inexpensive. I used it with some friends to make a trip out on the town to celebrate a birthday. It was awesome, fast service both going and returning.\n",
      "Earlier this year I attempted to apply as a driver but due to poor knowledge and a lack of direct communication provided by Uber I was unable to complete the hiring process. This company has no readily available personnel to assist you when you require immediate assistance. They simply direct you by text to attend an upcoming Uber meeting in some city if you have questions. They also collect and maintain personal driving records, personal identifiable information and documents of individuals who were unable to meet their requirements. Such information should be purged from their systems, not kept on file.\n",
      "I wonder how thoroughly the company's background check on prospective drivers really is. My concern comes from reports in the news on some drivers who have mental or otherwise criminal behavior.\n",
      "We used Uber for the first time to attend a wedding reception in Portland and we loved it. The ease of using it was awesome. The people that picked us up were professional, clean and friendly.\n",
      "I'm not pleased with the Uber. They may project charges through one of my credit cards that they tried to refuse to remove but they were probably removed later on. Bye-bye credit card company. Also one of the drivers ran my wife over and broke her back in three places.\n",
      "We only started using Uber this past year in Las Vegas, Nevada. A hotel staff member helped us download the app and use it. The drivers were very dependable, prompt and courteous. The cars were much cleaner than the cabs, and the rates were much lower. I am sorry to hear about the scandals that have recently besieged this company, and am hoping that the CEO's decision to take a leave of absence will help this company reform itself and improve its name. Unfortunately, Uber is not allowed to operate in my area, otherwise, my husband and I would use it more often.\n",
      "I booked an Uber XL from our hotel to the San Francisco International Airport with a 9 a.m. pickup. The quoted fare was $44-$57. Our hotel offered to take us for $17 per person, but we opted to take Uber for the personal service and efficiency. We had an excellent driver and vehicle but when we arrived at the airport I discovered that Uber charged me $99.26! The worst part about Uber is that they make it so easy to book a trip but then they make it so difficult to contact them regarding any issues.\n",
      "Uber drivers that I've dealt with have always been professional, safe drivers, and a pleasure to deal with. Their cars have always been clean, mostly newer models, and well-maintained. For the most part, the drivers get you in a short period time. However occasionally you might get a driver that suddenly realizes he doesn't want to take the call and you suddenly see on the map that he's going in a different direction. That could be frustrating when you're waiting for pick up, luckily, it has rarely happened. Overall, Uber is very good.\n",
      "Uber arrived to pick me up within 10 - 15 minutes of being called. Clean, comfortable vehicles and good music. Courteous drivers and safe driving habits. During rush hour in an area I was very familiar with, a driver was willing to divert from his GPS directions and go the way I told him would avoid the traffic. But one driver was a little less accommodating and dropped me off with luggage to carry, across the street from my destination.\n",
      "Uber is very convenient and always on time within five minutes of stated time and you always knew where they were at and how far away from you they were. I would recommend the service to anyone who needs a lift.\n",
      "My husband signed up for Uber online and schedule a pick up time to get the car,which was at 5:00pm at the office (location 04644)1398bryantstreet94102. we arrived 30 minutes before the scheduled time.People have been here since 11am and were exhausted. So we thought being as they closed at 5:00pm,we probably wouldnt have to be here as long. It's now after 6pm  and I had the time to write this review. Not only are we waiting for the longest, but every time we asked questions regarding the cars,no one seems to know what's going on. One of the workers said he's already off the clock and that he couldn't help. We further asked to speak with the manager and she was more unprofessional!!! She literally got pissed at one of the customers then claim \"she's doing us a favor\". I couldn't help but to let her know how unprofessional and very out of order she is...but she continued and even got mad at me also and shouting in her native language. DON'T COME HERE!!!\n",
      "We were left STRANDED in rural Framingham MA, after dark, with no way to return to our hotel. My colleague is disabled and must use a cane. The evening which would have been memorable for many other reasons I am sorry to say will probably remain memorable because of Uber's actions. The problem all started when the driver showed up at our hotel, the Hotel Sheraton in Framingham, early on Saturday evening, September 24, 2017. We had dinner reservations for 5:30 that evening at a Framingham-area historic inn that both of us had been eagerly looking forward to visiting.\n",
      "Arrived in LAX 8 hours ahead of schedule due to change of plans so our pickup wasn't available. My daughter suggested to try Uber so we did after comparing the fare going home which was about the same. A black shiny Suburban picked us up in less than 10 minutes. The van interior was clean so was the driver. He was pleasant to talk to and he drove us home safely. It was a pleasant experience that from now on, no more dirty taxis and smelly cab drivers for me.\n",
      "Using UBER was a pleasant surprise and I love the fact that they are available on short notice. The prices are much more affordable than the taxi cabs I was using prior to UBER and fare payment via credit card is great. They offer and deliver good service which I felt was safe and everything already in the system and no need to pull out anything. I also tried UBER as driver for several months... It was fun! I only had one incident that caused me concern after calling UBER and confirming a ride. Between 11:00-11:30 pm close to a price surge time, I was switched to several different driver confirmations which caused a 45-minute wait and that night I finally called a cab.\n",
      "I live in a very small town and at times there is no one available to pick up. Uber is great in large metropolitan areas. Drivers are very polite and punctual. I noticed that the ride would state a different amount, however after I am dropped off the price has increased. There is no customer service number. I understand that even the drivers don't have a main number to contact for Uber Corporate. That is a serious issue. Every company should have a human to speak with for concerns.\n",
      "I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is \"wrong\". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is.Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example.I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind.My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend?FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.\n",
      "I have used Uber 3 times. Once the driver got lost, causing me to miss my bus and costing me $60 extra fare. The other times were ok but I believe way overpriced. Sorry, not a fan.\n",
      "I used Uber for a couple of medical appointments. The drivers were prompt and so friendly and I could not have been happier. The cars were spotless and I had lots of floor space. The rides were smooth because the cars were very nice and that's important with all my back issues. I highly recommend Uber to anyone and everyone!\n",
      "The service was convenient (just a phone call and they came to our location). The drivers were always on time, courteous, and helpful. Their fee was usually less than the commercial cab fares and the vehicles were all clean and efficient.\n",
      "It's a really great thing. They should have more incentives for discount rides after you build up lots of rides or give them references for business. But other than that they are very safe and a great concept.\n",
      "I am in a non-profit organization that is financially assisting seniors with no other transportation choices to use Uber via 24-Hour Care home health. Our Friends of Outreach will pay the app fees and the charge for rides for vetted seniors through the non-profit via the city of Irvine. Certain seniors who don't have access to a phone that can connect the apps, and also don't meet the criteria for use of other transportation modes we support financially, are using the service on a trial basis on 12-week contracts. So far so good.\n",
      "Quick and efficient service, clean cars, and polite staff. Sets the standard our local cab services should aspire to. All this at half the price.\n",
      "My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.\n",
      "When in Ann Arbor the Uber driver was polite and helpful but when in Chicago most drivers DID not come out of the car or speak unless we spoke except to ask where to. Also, the driver was not especially courteous or helpful. This was my first encounter with using Uber.\n",
      "I use UBER when I go to Pittsburgh when my daughter wants me to go shopping, and doesn't want me to walk. She lives in Stanton Heights and the store is Shop-N-Save on Butler St in Lawrenceville and I feel very safe taking an UBER.\n",
      "Used Uber once. Great experience and great concept for getting around without a great expense. Thought about making extra money as a driver. Rules for personal safety are for me. Overall, good business.\n",
      "I waited through several drivers. I was in an unfamiliar neighborhood, but did describe my location adequately. When a driver finally showed up, he was hearing impaired; there was some difficulty making myself understood, but did make it to the airport in time, esp. as the flight was delayed. He drove quite fast, taking shortcuts. Made me a little concerned about safety.\n",
      "They were always prompt, knowledgeable, courteous and professional. They are ideal for when you are out of town and I plan to use them often.\n",
      "My child and my girl need to go to school early in the morning, I request an Uber taxi who cleverly went to the destination to pick my family (**) and then he call me, \"I am here where you at?\" I reply, \"In front of my building\" and he said of the put the wrong address to put up but the driver did not say nothing if he coming or not. I trying to call him back and an automate it machine say that I have to call from my account phone number and the driver charge me for nothing, well my babies are late for school. I decide to request another car and in the map said 4 minutes. Well I thought maybe with this other car they can make it??? The driver (**) cancel literately in front of the building and this is not the right way they do business and treat your customer. And both were late - one for school and the other to college. Good job UBER.\n",
      "Driver was prompt and friendly. Found out drivers rate passengers (they can alert other drivers of potentially be or aggressive riders) and passengers can rate the drivers which becomes company knowledge.\n",
      "I used Uber during my stay in Las Vegas, Nevada and it was a good experience. I was taken directly to my destination and arrived right on time and Uber driver was a very friendly lady and I really enjoyed laughing and talking with her during the trip.\n",
      "I have used Uber in Orlando and NYC. The use of the current technology helps to obtain ground transportation very fast but the exception is during a rainstorm. In NYC, I had challenges obtaining transportation.\n",
      "My first experience with Uber was taken from Seattle Airport. The vehicle was really clean and the driver was very courteous, safe driver and professional.\n",
      "I don't like the Uber. Uber should be used as a personal driving tool for any type of driver. For one you use your own personal source of transportation to help the public where another public transportation would not help, or satisfy the need of the public. It sound like there is a lot of conflicting areas going on, and more work in progress, of some kinda get back.\n",
      "Uber to LGB airport on June 6, 2017 should be about $14.00-$15.00 but instead it was $21.50. She took the long way and got lost on the freeway then had to backtrack.\n",
      "Originally a wonderful, less expensive and convenient alternative to cabs but it has become more awkward and expensive as popularity has grown.\n",
      "Warning uber is a scam and there is no customer service and there drivers are drunks and drug addicts and sexual harassment\n",
      "I just had a terrible experience with Uber pool. I ordered it for the first time yesterday on a route that I've taken many times before with UberX. My phone is older, so the Uber app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Uber pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UberX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Uber pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UberX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing. I went to the car and was told to get out because he had already cancelled. I was charged a $5 cancellation fee.\n",
      "I absolutely love Uber! They are very convenient, quick and for the most part very safe. I use Uber every day and I've only had a few issues which weren't that traumatic. As of this point, I don't know what I would do without Uber. I rely on them to go everywhere and in the case of needing to go to an event where it's going to be packed, with parking being horrible, Uber is a no-brainer. They drop you off close to the event, you don't have to worry about paying for a high prices parking spot. Overall, I am very happy with Uber.\n",
      "I've always found Uber reliable and professional nationwide. They are my go-to choice for transportation when I travel for business or pleasure.\n",
      "PROS: Really easy to use and fast arrival time of the car. CONS: Background check doubtful and sometimes car description is not accurate.\n",
      "My driver was personable, and made me feel safe. It was good to come across a patriot rather than the grunts and groans one usually encounters with car service drivers.\n",
      "The driver we had was very professional and polite and he was easy to talk to and understand. He was also nicely dressed along with being very helpful with other points of interest that we might like. Plus, he took good care of his vehicle and kept it very clean. Because of him we will be glad to try Uber again if needed.\n",
      "We didn't want to drive in San Francisco after parking at our hotel. We used Uber 4 times and found the response times fast and the drivers courteous and careful to obey laws. We knew about the higher prices at rush times and were not surprised at the higher but reasonable charge during the one time we rode at 5:30 pm. We will use Uber again on our trips to unfamiliar cities.\n",
      "First of all you can't talk to anyone at Uber because they do not have phone support. After I finally found the online support team I asked why I was getting charged a monthly fee. I never opened an account with them. They did not know and continued to charge me even after I told them to stop. Instead my monthly bill got higher. They asked me to prove they were billing me by sending them screen snapshots and the last four of my credit card. Can you believe that? I had to prove to them that this was happening. So I did and then they asked me to give them the first 6 numbers on my credit card. Which I did. This company is either very incompetent or corrupt. I will never use their service!\n",
      "New driver over 2 hours online - Trying to contact UBER is literally impossible. I was sent a delivery message which lasted approx 1 second and then disappeared. I then went on my first call and was unable to slide to commence the ride. When I did slide it I was virtually at the destination. Being unable to contact UBER to explain anything is a total waste.\n",
      "I used Uber for the first time in the Washington, DC area several months ago. My son who lives there showed me how to use the app; within just a few minutes, our ride arrived and we were safely back at our location. Waiting for public transit would have been over an hour transport time. The driver was very professional and nice.\n",
      "I enjoy the cheap cost, but I feel saddened by the negative impact on the taxi drivers that have far better qualifications to drive people around. So many Uber drivers do not know the area in which they drive and are not safe drivers, often not obeying basic driving rules.\n",
      "I was in L.A. and a friend had the Uber account and software on her phone so she put-in the requests. I used Uber twice (maybe three times) in L.A... They were fairly short rides that went very, very well. The drivers were very friendly and the cars they were driving were newish and clean.\n",
      "For solo travelers, this is the best, cheapest, safest way to go. The savings vs a cab is tremendous. I used Uber in Philadelphia from a parking garage to a dinner cruise then to a outdoor festival. Even at midnight, they pick you up. Go Uber and stay safe.\n",
      "I ordered an Uber today @ 9:45 for a 10:00 appt I had at the doc. At first I was told to walk over two blocks to meet the driver for my convenience. I waited around 15 minutes and kept on tracking the driver but no car showed up. After thoroughly checking the entire block I found him across the street. I quickly ran over but he informed me that my ride was cancelled and I'll have to order a car again. I did and they assigned me another driver (not this one) five minutes away. That driver canceled me after five minutes. I ordered another one but he never showed. I ended up walking the 1.2 mile to my appt. I will never use Uber again. They have absolutely no reliability and no customer service. I will try Lyft in the future.\n",
      "I had 4 guests (5 of us total) so ordered an Uber XL, which is advertised to seat 6 people. When I pulled up the order, I had the choice of an Uber X for $15 or an Uber XL for $35. Knowing that there would be 6 people with the driver, I ordered the Uber XL. When the car arrived, it was a small SUV (5 passenger vehicle) and the driver told us to \"squeeze in\". I have emailed Uber numerous times about this issue and have had no luck getting anything but an automated response saying that the issue has been resolved and that I should order an Uber XL for larger groups (which is what I did, but did not get an Uber XL). I have requested the $20 refund for the price difference with no success. It is not necessarily about the $20 - it is the principle. And it is also illegal for them to drive with 4 people \"squeezed in\" the back seat. It was embarrassing to me, as these were out of town guests. I do have 4 other witnesses that can verify the size of the vehicle.\n",
      "Used their service for a week of vacation in downtown Chicago. Drivers were always available and service was quite prompt. The drivers and vehicles were clean and they were concerned for our safety by good driving practices. Even the pickup and drop off from the USA women's soccer game in Soldiers field was accomplished to our satisfaction even though the area was crowded with spectators. The prices were very reasonable. Very satisfied with the service.\n",
      "I like the Uber app which lets me know where their cars are in proximity to my location, who my driver is, what car they are driving and when they will arrive to pick me up. I love that I do not have to tip. I get in the car and the driver already knows where I want to go. I get out as soon as we arrive and immediately get an opportunity to rate the driver. The service is great.\n",
      "There was an error in my billing causing me to believe my account was hacked. I cancelled my card and asked my CC company to reverse the charge. This is several months ago. To date I can get no response from Uber to confirm how much I actually owe them and my account is frozen.\n",
      "First time I used Uber, they were great. The second time, they got lost trying to find me (I was at a public high school) and just gave up. They texted me to cancel. Didn't even call to try to work anything out or send another driver. I won't be using them again.\n",
      "I had to use Uber for a few occasions when my car needed repair. I used the app which is really convenient to use. It shows you what cars are in your local area, how close they are to your location. They show you who the driver is, and approximately how soon they can arrive. I found that my drivers were polite, good drivers. I will use them again as needed.\n",
      "Uber is great for transportation for medical appointments. The call center has always been prompt and courteous with me. The drivers I've had in the past have been very caring and loyal to their customers. They were pleasant, caring, compassionate, and humorous as well. The only thing that has ever bothered me is the extensive wait time for pickup from my appointments. Uber puts more on their drivers than should be in my opinion. I have personally seen the stress and anxiety in the drivers.\n",
      "Not a real frequent user, but every experience the same. Close by, on time, good drivers, nice conversation if we initiate, safe to destination, no problem at the end of the ride.\n",
      "It's an economic and convenient service. I like the convenience of the app and being able to track just where my driver is. I've never had any situations that I felt were unsafe or threatening.\n",
      "I started using UBER while on vacation in Arizona a couple years ago. Took it to and from the airport. I was shocked on how easy it was! I LOVE that there is no money that exchanges hands at all. I was a little leery about providing my credit card info when I signed up but I've never had a problem. I've used UBER so many times since then in different places... Like Chicago! It's just so much cheaper than a cab plus the drivers are usually very friendly and like to tell you about different places to visit (if you're a tourist). Recently I was on a trip to San Francisco and used UBER the whole time. Something new I learned about while there was UBER POOL. The driver picks up a number of people at different stops and drops everyone off at their pre-determined destination and it was only $4.99 per trip because you are sharing a ride with others. Very cool!\n",
      "Uber began as a very reputable alternative to other livery services, however, that has changed. Rates are quoted as one amount and billed higher. The drivers are miserable, some of them actually hit their female customers. Uber's customer service is literally non-existent and with the exception of booking a car, all of their online services are at best horrible.\n",
      "Uber is great as long as you are traveling by yourself or with someone over age 4. If you're a single mom with a baby there are ZERO cars that offer baby seats. You are expected to lug a seat with you which is horrible if you are trying to go out shopping or something. You can't exactly lug around a giant car seat. Single moms need an option too. There also aren't many women drivers, I have only seen one.\n",
      "Rates are very reasonable. Pickup times are pretty prompt. However, sometimes they come early then charge for wait time and a few times I had to wait on them. Cars are usually very clean and comfortable. Drivers are not always chatty so it depends on preference if you like to talk or not, BUT they are concentrating on GPS etc. One driver I had didn't stop for stop signs and he must have thought the signs said ROLL.\n",
      "I was charged 208 Rand and received a receipt to reflect that amount. Then, I was subsequently charged an additional 60 Rand with no additional receipt or support for the adjustment. When I checked the Uber App, it shows a consolidated charge of 268 Rand, but conveniently state that the receipt is unavailable. Customer Service has not been helpful and have yet to provide me with any documentation to support the adjusted fare. Uber has progressively gotten worse over the years, so this is the last straw for me. They need to understand that they are no longer the only low-cost option and improve their customer service.\n",
      "Same of your drivers have different things in their car. All drivers should care some extra things but I have always been happy with the service.\n",
      "I've used Uber many times in the past but I would never use Uber now! Many times I have been billed for rides where the driver literally drove right by me, and I'd have to call for another ride. You are automatically billed $5 if you miss your pickup. INSANITY! The procedure to get your $5 back that has literally been stolen from you is so time-consuming. It simply isn't worth the bother. I already had an unsatisfactory opinion of Uber - before all the HORRIBLENESS that they are today, June 13th 2017... So I'd say, try to catch a Lyft with someone else!\n",
      "My granddaughter and I ordered an uber from santa monica beach pier . Three drivers cancelled and I was charged for the third one with them stating that the driver waited over 2 minutes for me. I was at the pickup point long before I ever contacted this driver. He evidently left  and charged me with a cancellation fee and I followed the rules. Uber has shown to a very shadowy company from the get go. From now on, I will be a customer of Lyft! I have disputed this with the BBB, no response from uber so now I am making you aware.\n",
      "I haven't had a problem with Uber until now. I ride Uber religiously to work every morning. I purchase their Uber gift card from their app's website. I always purchase a new one before the old runs out so that I have continuous funds. On Sept the 6th I started having major problems. I ride Uber now in the evenings to a new job about 2.26 miles. I currently have a gift card on file on Sept 6 for 50.00 and some change. I took Uber to work that evening but when I got ready to request the ride home it stated I had an outstanding balance of 1.20 cent from my ride to work that evening. I thought that's not right. I have over 50.00 on the gift card last purchased. Here I was at night outside my job trying to figure out where the mistake was. \n",
      "I suddenly became very ill at work. I usually take the bus home, but was too ill to do that. I got on my phone and saw that many Uber vehicles were already circling my block at work, so a vehicle arrived promptly, before I could even come down on the elevator. The driver was a woman who was a previous healthcare worker, and she assured me that I could relax, and not to worry. If I got sick she could take care of me. Talk about customer service! She was so kind, I immediately felt better.\n",
      "Both Uber vehicles were not clean, old and uncomfortable. Although no tip was required I offered and they accepted. Not overly pleased with the rides.\n",
      "I started using Uber about four months ago. My first two rides went perfectly. I was able to state where I was located, as well as the two locations that I wanted to go to. However, the third time that I wanted to use Uber, I was no longer able to put in two locations, just one. I didn't realize that at that point, and only realized it once a driver was driving me to my primary location. My driver was amazing enough to drive me to my second location; as thanks for this, I paid him with the few dollars that I had in my wallet.\n",
      "Uber is very convenient and reasonable. I have used it often and have only been disappointed once. That time the driver took a longer route to my house. I rated the driver low and Uber contacted me right away and modified my trip charge!\n",
      "The first time I used Uber was in SF. Several times they were fantastic, then NYC that was not as great but still very good. Just took longer in NYC and not as friendly.\n",
      "Recently I took an Uber from Ft Lauderdale airport to Miami International Airport and I was told that the cost was going to be $37. However when I received my PayPal invoice, it stated that I was charged $48. It made me upset because that seemed like a price gouge that I'm noticing that Uber does. I was probably better off catching a regular taxi. Since then I have not used Uber and probably won't use it again!\n",
      "When my wife died a few states away the Sunday before Thanksgiving 2016, I needed to get home to NJ. They were awful at Newark Airport. Some drivers came \"disguised\" as UBER drivers and would not take me where I NEEDED to go. Nor were some of them UBER drivers to begin with. 2 Drivers put me & luggage in car, pulled away from EWR, asked where to, heard where to and said, \"Sorry, get out.\" They are never available in Suburbia late at night and very early AM.\n",
      "Terrible experience with Uber service today. The rider Roger, Chrysler 300, 7LHV109 accepted my ride request but never showed up and ignored my calls and text messages. My App showed he was sitting near a shopping plaza a mile away instead of picking me up. After 35 minutes in the heat, my cell phone died and I had to take a taxi. Terrible service! And Uber charged me money for its driver's failure!\n",
      "The Uber drivers that we used were OK. One was creepy and the other two ladies were nice. The one thing they all had in common, they were SLOW. They drive way below the speed limit and I felt like I was never going to get to my destination.\n",
      "I have used Uber all over the world and it has always been prompt and convenient, as well as cheaper than a standard taxi. The drivers have always been polite and some have also been more friendly. I do have reservations about many aspects of the so-called gig economy and feel a little guilty when I use services such as Uber, but I cannot fault the service I have received as a customer.\n",
      "At first there was an issue with my charges... I was in the wrong and very nasty with Uber's cust service. Because I felt I was being ripped off. I said I will sleep on it and voila... first thing in the morning not only was the correct amount adjusted to my bank but it was less than what I thought. Way to go Uber. I stand corrected and I will not only recommend your service to my friends and colleagues but I will use your services AGAIN when I need a ride. Plus you taught patience to an old pushy dog. Lol great job and will be contacting you guys soon!!! Thank you.\n",
      "I've taken Uber only half a dozen times, and all but one were pleasant experiences. The unpleasant experience went beyond the pale however. I probably could have contacted Uber during the ride and I'm sure arrangements would have been made to care for the problem, as their customer service has always been stellar. All told, Uber has been a lifesaver on those occasions I didn't want to drive.\n",
      "I have used Uber as a passenger and I am a part-time driver with them. I get outstanding rating and comments from my passengers. I would like to see more of the drivers I get also really care about the passenger they are transporting (me).\n",
      "It was my first time using the service and I found it to be quite convenient. The app was easy to use. I was able to download it and then order the car quickly. The car arrived when they said it would and being able to track the location of the car before it arrived was cool. Paying in advance was also convenient since it meant you knew the cost of the ride beforehand and the price didn't change for slow traffic or anything else.\n",
      "For the most part, Uber is convenient and fast. Need a way to tip. 1 driver with road rage, but very much the exception. Still way better vetting than taxis.\n",
      "This was one old, small, worn out Uber vehicle for an hour trip to the airport. Ft Collins to Denver airport. But the driver was friendly and drove safely.\n",
      "Used Uber while in Boston MA. Driver was excellent and knew his way around during peak driving time after work. We used Uber 3 times and always got to our destination on time.\n",
      "I have used Uber many times, and each time I have been exceedingly pleased. The drivers were prompt, courteous, and professional. I highly recommend Uber.\n",
      "Great for the rider, they get quick service. Poor pay for the drivers due to a flooded market. No concern given to the fact that if you hire too many drivers there will not be enough riders to make the trips worth your time and fuel.\n",
      "The experience with Uber is entirely dependent on the driver. One driver took excellent care of me while another driver almost left me off miles from my destination in an industrial park, not a hotel. I threatened to call the police.\n",
      "Please, please use Lyft or a cab service. Uber is just awful. I had a driver verbally abuse me this morning, so I asked Uber for a full refund. They gave me a $5 credit, and basically said they don't think my situation warrants a full refund. Clearly this company supports abusive drivers over their customers. I will NEVER be using their services again.\n",
      "I was picked up from my workplace on 30/8/2017 at around 8:56 pm by cab no. TN 07 CE 8554. The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.\n",
      "Worst customer service I've ever encountered.  Every response is just a copy/paste canned response...they don't even read the actual complain/comment/request.  I have to send my issue to them 7-10 times with multiple responses back...that's about 30-40 emails back and forth to get something as simple as a $5 cancelation ride waived because the app froze and I couldn't cancel in time.  It's just ridiculous.  Glad all the Sr. leaders of the company resigned or were fired.  Hopefully it changes the culture, but I doubt it, all the customer service reps are nasty ass offshore peeps that don't care about anything but their \"ticket resolution\" numbers.\n",
      "I needed Uber when moving to Mexico City for work. I created an account and put in debit card, credit card, and PayPal accounts. Uber said the cards were invalid and that they could not connect to Paypal. I checked with my banks to make sure they had accepted the validation amounts sent by Uber. Uber NEVER contacted either bank to verify my cards. When speaking to Uber, they refused to address this issue. They merely told me how to add a payment method. As far as the PayPal problems, they just ignored that.\n",
      "Hi. For 4 days - we have been trying to change a phone number on an existing UBER account, to no avail (also lost 4 days of discount from a coupon that we had for that account). No access to a LIVE person - all done with automated responses that did not address our inquiries. Shame - they started off so well, and then - unjustified cancellation fees, technological issues, lack of customer support and so much more.\n",
      "I just wanted to write and let all of you at Uber that I had the most amazing driver the other day! As soon as I got in the car, he handed me a bowl of delicious treats, I thought that was so sweet! Then he handed me a bottle of water.  This may not be a big deal to some, however, it actually made my day! He was so polite, helpful, generous and all around awesome!!! Please please let this driver, Jasur Nazarou # 5756433 know that he is awesome!! He deserves some sort of praise from all of you at Uber! All of your drivers should take notes from this guy! All of your drivers need to be like him!!! WONDEEFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!Stephanie Angelini  @Angelinistephanie.  *****@yahoo.com.\n",
      "I had purchased a $50 Uber gift card thru the phone app and used my debit card. There was a problem with email addresses and changed phone numbers so that my son did not get the monies I paid for. I had to wait for the funds to reappear as Uber had to merge email accounts. 3 weeks and still nothing. There is NO LIVE SUPPORT. LINKS IN EMAILS ARE DEAD ENDS. The phone # 855.741.1209 is a third party and cannot verify app ecard purchases. I have left many messages for a call back... nothing.\n",
      "I recently started driving for UBER and you know what everything has been exactly as it was supposed to be. Will there be a hiccup at some point? Probably. But all of you who are saying you got ripped off so many times, first of all I don't believe it has happened as often and as badly as you all claim but if it has happened to you more than 2 times then maybe instead of bit@#$ing about it you should just stop using it. I drive because I need the extra money and most of the problems you may or may not have are caused by the app or the company not the drivers. I am very professional and have not had one issue with a rider or the app as of yet and I depend on the money to support my family so I take it very seriously. Please at the very least don't give drivers bad ratings because your fare was too high or the wait was too long. we get there as fast as we can at least the good drivers. Bad reviews for the drivers when it is the app or the companies rates fault can cause us to be deactivated. I like the extra money I earn and depend on it to do fun things with my family. Rant over.\n",
      "I had to request a pickup several times since the drivers were waiting for it to be midnight for the price surge. They were cancelling my pickup and I was getting charged for the cancellation. The next day the driver said she couldn't find me although the next driver had no issues. I was again charged a cancellation fee. The unprofessional driver hung up on me when I was giving specific directions trying to make it easier to find me. I was visiting LA and staying in Santa Monica. These experiences somewhat soured my trip.\n",
      "I've spent a total of 3 hours over 8 days trying to install UBER on my phone. I type in my phone number and it asks me for my password. Seems pretty simple. I type in my password and I'm told it's the incorrect password. I know this to not be true, so I try again, more carefully and still get the incorrect password message. I type in the email address associated with my password and am told it's not the correct email address. I try and reset my password and fall into an infinite loop that doesn't give me a response. \n",
      "Uber not paying the extra money in the lite up area now rip me off 2 times in the glendale area after the cards games tonites owes me about 30 plus more taking more then 25% to trying to keep the college kids happy but dont care about the drivers to most of the rides are short about 262- 300 dallorsfars now taking away the wait till you get the ride then keep the money for themsevles to if you want to make nothing dont do uber thris company needs to be shut down getting like reg cab company only cares about the money you avg 4.00 a ride in the phoenix area now so please use someone else at peak times\n",
      "She continually amazed me with her skill and expertise on the road. She was very kind and courteous and knew every possible avenue of travel. Props to Uber for their fine selection.\n",
      "I will never understand why the drivers of the self driving UBER CAR in Tempe Arizona. Are not drugged tested, I know a few that would test positive. How could UBER put the risk of peoples, lives at risk. Also open their self up for a huge lawsuit.\n",
      "I prepaid $100 on the Uber app to ensure that I had no problems while traveling. On 7/30/17 I attempted to prearrange a pickup for the following day at 0700 for a 0900 class that was essential to upgrade my professional license. I was unable to schedule a pick up and received the message \"request failed, please enter new payment method.\" I contacted UBER help who assured me that they were having trouble with prearranged services and should have no problem the following morning. \n",
      "I recently took an Uber and was checking my trips the next day and see that I was being charged a cleaning fee of $150. My driver's name was Michael and picked me up in Delray Beach Florida and dropped me off in Boca Raton Florida. The ride cost $18.42. When I asked Uber through the Uber help I was advised I was being charged a cleaning fee. I then received pictures of vomit that was on the seat and the floor. This was something that I absolutely did not do. I have asked that the community manager in my area call me and I have not received any response. These pictures that were submitted were not from me. I feel violated and feel nothing I can do but dispute these charges with my bank.\n",
      "I requested an UberX, and was told he'd arrived, \"Will ** (Willie)\"... I made my way outside only to find him gone. I checked my App to see if he'd canceled, only to find that I was \"on my way\". How could that be, if I was still home. I emailed Uber about this situation, Harsh ** asked for details. I responded providing screenshots, and after 3 hours of waiting and hearing nothing, I was told they wouldn't be issuing a refund because based on the trip details, it \"looks like the trip took place\"... SMH, WTF. I even offered to provide a picture of myself, and asked them to contact the driver about whom he picked up, but to no avail. Thoroughly disgusted with Uber.\n",
      "Unable to retrieve phone left in Uber car in 30 days of nonstop attempts. Surely, I am not the only one who has left their phone after leaving a party and surely, I am not the only one who greatly depends on their phone!!! No customer service at all.\n",
      "I'm a driver. I drove several times this past weekend 8/10-8/13. I had several rides that were surges. Customers even told me their ride was a surge. Now after all is said and done, Uber doesn't want to pay me my correct pay. This is not the first time this has happened to me. I'm just now tired of fighting with them in giving me money they owe me. Be warned if you decide to be a driver for Uber. They will short you your pays and you will continue to get scripted replies from someone in another country.\n",
      "I never knew there is going to be such difficult task to contact Uber's customer service about an issue me and my husband had. In fact there is no customer service per se but a critical safety response line which wasn't much of the help in our problem. What happened is that my husband left in Uber his wallet with all his documents, id cards, credit cards, pictures etc. He really got stressed out about it a lot, we contacted Uber through an app right away as we were not able to reach the driver. You must know that you really can't reach the driver even though the Uber app would transfer your call to him. The driver never picked up his phone nor there was a voicemail set up so we could leave a message. From Saturday night until Monday night we didn't know anything about the lost wallet. At least he could call back or e-mail us that he found or didn't find it.\n",
      "I finally caved and opened an account with UBER in order to take a ride from Hallandale to the Fort Lauderdale Airport to fly home. I was under the impression that the first ride was free, but I could not find the place to enter the code. Nevertheless, I was picked up and dropped off for a charge of $17.94. Once at the gate, I thought I would go back into the app and learn about it, and perhaps discover where to enter promo codes. That's when I saw that a second charge of $97.94 had been applied. To make a long story short, and after a number of back and forth emails with UBER, it seems that my driver Yuniel, who could not speak a word of English, claimed that my dog (which I do not have) had urinated all over his seats. The UBER reply after the fourth email included photos.\n",
      "I live in San Francisco (city) and have been using Uber for about two years. About six months ago I had the first issue with two drivers that I had to report for violations. My score has always been 5 stars until then, but Uber is allowing drivers to leave a negative rating for riders that have reported them or left a negative feedback due to unprofessional, rude, dangerous behavior. My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way. When he heard we were going to contact Uber immediately, he left us on the sidewalk with bags and kept on making us pay for a ride we weren't benefitting of.\n",
      "Uber charged my card for a ride that did not take place. I was notified by my bank of an Uber charge on a weekend during which I never left home. Attempting to contact Uber by phone, or submit a fraudulent statement via their website both proved impossible. The last Uber contact number would not recognize my phone number. Their website would not permit the required screen shot of the fraudulent bank transaction. Ultimately, I resorted to closing the card, reasoning if it happened once, it will certainly happen again. Shame on you Uber.\n",
      "First off. Almost impossible to try and find a way to send in a technical question. Once I got someone they totally misunderstood my issue. Then assigned it a \"RESOLVED\" tag (when it WASN'T!!!), then discontinued contact. NEVER HAD MY ISSUE RESOLVED AND NOW THEY WONT RESPOND. This company is WAY TOO DIFFICULT to deal with. Giving up. Just gonna stick with Yellow Taxis from now on.\n",
      "I ordered an Uber to get to an interview in Tempe and I live in Gilbert. I had the same Uber drive to and from the interview... David. On the ride there he charged me the normal amount. Then on the way back he charged me an extra 50$ for an \"accident\" in the car. There was no accident I was at an interview! I would love to know what I did. They make up accidents so that they can make more money. It is ridiculous. This is one of the worst company's to use. DO NOT USE THEM. Use lyft they are way more trustworthy and will not cheat you and take your money!\n",
      "I was recently in Seattle for a fun trip. Used Uber several times without a problem. But then all of a sudden they charged me $250 out of nowhere to which they never did respond. But thank God my bank denied that fee. Then I asked for a ride, they cancelled on me, yet said I was not at the location I requested, then charged me $5 for a cancelled ride, NOT!!! And trying to contact customer service is a joke, to say the least. I have not used Lyft yet but will now be checking that out. Uber is a big rip off be careful out there!!!\n",
      "The drivers are rude and refuse to come at the pickup location _ Drivers Name : Kamaljeet PB 01A5756. They have an excuse of getting charged for the parking lot. as well when asked to come at pick location straight away says no. Another person in the que is Baldev with Car number\n",
      "Attempting to schedule a ride with Uber using their app failed 6, 8 or more times because the app could not verify the card security code on the back of the three credit cards I had entered into the app. I was returning home from shopping with frozen goods and was relying on Uber to get home. After several failed attempts, I noticed that Uber had shifted into surge pricing and then into a still higher surge pricing. I finally was able to schedule a ride. However I believe I drove up my own rate because I had requested so many rides until the app took hold. I have asked Uber to investigate my concern and have not heard back from them, and my original message has been deleted.\n",
      "I'm a Uber driver and I took a couple of riders happens to be a husband and wife. When I picked up the riders, the women (wife) was badly intoxicated and sitting on a sidewalk. It was my first time so I didn't know what will happen next. I picked them up from LA and we're headed to Torrance at 1 am. By the time I nearly got to their destination, the wife threw up in my car. The husband helped catch the puke onto his shirt but since it's liquid, most of the throw up soaked into my back leather seat and couldn't do anything about it. I did completed the trip to their home and they got out of the car. \n",
      "The worst company I have ever been involved with.......I had driven for them for over 6 months.....Had great reviews from my customers.....I even eventually took part in their Xchange leasing program...so they were getting a double bump from me...well after learning that I really could not make enough money paying all my bills with them I had to divest some of my time to get another job....well I ended up going out of the country for 3 weeks on a potential employment trip....so fell behind on some leasing payments...I immedieately tried to communicate my situation with them and see if I could work out something...well because you cannot talke to anyone on the phone until last week...you can see how difficutl it would be to communicate my situation....after finally getting someone to talk to on the phone...they basically told me they could not do anything I needed to talk to Xchange leasing...after months of talking to a \"warranty company' which I found out was Xchange leasing in disguise...ran by a bunch of people who are not capable of having discussions about leasing issues...and continually pushing the discussion to a warranty discussion....that lead to why cant these people tell me they are Xchange leasing?...something really weird here....So long story short about 1 week of having my first discussion with an actual discussion human at UBER they come and take my car and to this day I have not had one open honest talk with Xchange leasing.......What an insult!!! Never invest your time in this company because they could care a less about the drivers, the REAL people out there bringing in the money...Oh but you will get a lot of fake pretend recordings on their call phone while you wait for hours before talking with them........I have never felt so insulted....after giving of my time to this excuse of a company...I just get mad thinking about it....and they will keep pretending they care I am sure.....................Bad Company\n",
      "For all there data, which is impressive, they have no idea or are just plain heartless, that taxis drive  19.1 mph. Which translates to $13.62 per hour. The same # all the other drivers mention.  I am giving it up and I work mostly in the Hamptons, NY, where they raise the rate 60-70% to $22.31 per hour.  People have no problem paying more ant the Hamptons rate should be the BASE rate. Basically this app sucks. I agree with a previous review that said you make pennies. Consider this, you drive 12 min to pickup, do a 5 min fare, and collect $3.67.  BTW, you have no idea where you are going. So now you are 5 min further out of your way. Stay on the N. Fork (LI) and do garbage fares for $13/hr or drive to the S. Fork with nothing? Nobody tips, 8% of people.  Sure it's in the app, but I could not find it for my fare in their phone. Sure you work the \"Surge\" 1.8X, wow, now you make $20 and hour and get a red light ticket/pulled over because you don't know where you are.  Not to mention, you never work a surge for an hour because it disappears as  you approach, they know you are coming.  Therefore to make money, you turn off the app....no you don't make money or work that hour for a surge.  BTW there are 1000 ubers around you at all times, watching the ants on the consumer app drives you nuts. Lyft shows you were they are at any location: another form of torture as it confirms your good spot is taken up by 23 Lyfts (which is about 60% of the Uber fleet). 3 Long hauls to NYC for a \"Bro price\" which not only includes gas, but lunch too: 2:35 hours to make $82, or 1:05 to make $80 when picked up in the Hamptons. I complained about the 82 fare, Uber said it was Kosher: sure I dropped at LaGuardia AND MIDTOWN in rush hour, no worries. Sat night I earned $296 in the Hamptons, minus gas in 10 hours.  I KNOW THE HAMPTONS and have driven taxis since '99 part time.  This is what a good driver gets for driving 300 miles. Every night I drive is 250-300 miles. 1000's of miles add up.  Uber will get you out of a financial jam, and I will use it on MONGO nights: Concerts/Labor day, but it sucks and they have no problem having it suck for the driver, evidenced by the fares.  That's all I got...oh yeah, premium/select drivers do 10% premium fares (30% of their profit), but do 90% of the base x fare.  So they make....$18 per hour to pay for their Mercedes:) or grind it into dust. XL Fares are few and far in between, unlike gas stations for my Yukon.  My car was a Charger 25 mpg+.  NO Money in it. As the last fare said, give this up...and wait tables. I did get $210 for the puker in my car from S.Hampton, same care I put my kids in.......delete the app is what I should do.\n",
      "Uber is a very disrespectful company they let Driver  cuss you out treat you like your Nothing threw your thing's out of the car over charged customer Uber doesn't care who's driving the car or who's playing for the ride someone else was using my account information taking trip when I found out I cancel my debit card and Uber got mad and cancel my account because I want my money back Uber doesn't care about anyone they let one of there women passenger get RAPE because one of uber Driver let his friend use the car and he RAPE her Uber tryed hide the RAPE saying it was there FAULT I'm glad Uber cancel my account I don't have to worry about being cuss out or my things threw out the car or worrying about being RAPE Thank you very much Uber\n",
      "I have been an Uber passenger multiple times with no problems. When there is a problem there is no one to help. I ask for a phone number and they say they have no phone support. Just email. I was charged double what was stated and my Uber account had me going to a different destination than what I went to. I emailed multiple times with a reply saying \"resolved\". That is the price. I don't think so. No one really read my complaints. I kept emailing until my last email said \"sorry your ride was more than 30 days out, closed\". I have emailed several more times with no response. Uber is right... always, they won't listen to you and customer support stinks! My 16 dollar trip as stated on the app was $33.00. Final!\n",
      "UBER does not care about drivers and their vehicles!!! For most issues, they have people responding in the Philippines (initially they say \"We are offshore\"), who are trained to use initially prepared ready texts. Those guys do not disclose any unique info like employee ID, ext., initials etc., imitate work on the issue, imitate care, imitate responsibility. Every time a different person responds under the veil of anonymity. You can't talk to a manager. Their system is designed to discourage drivers to resolve their issues, to confuse them and distance them. On top of all, UBER doesn't want to be sued. They want arbitration! UBER also doesn't like class action measures! How is this possible that in the USA the government allows an american corporation to play games with people and avoid responsibility?\n",
      "ON 7/30/17 I was in Oregon alone on a trip at the University needing a ride to PDX to get home to CA. I chose Uber over Lyft because they had a driver available and the time of arrival worked for me, I was to arrive at 5:11 to the airport PDX which would have been plenty of time. But with him getting lost to me looking for gas. And me having to use the app to guide him to my pick up locations I ended up being 45minutes late which therefore made me miss my plane. I'm sorry. This is unacceptable from Uber, feeling helpless at the time and that was not what I was quoted. My time that you gave me was to ARRIVE at 5:11 to PDX that gave me 1:35 min to catch my flight I WAS 45 minutes late!\n",
      "I had bought an Uber card so I will have a way to work for pretty high amount! I was allowed to use the card at first but then I cannot use it anymore. I try to go through customer service but it's no good. They run you around in circles and they took money out of my account after I bought the credits. They tell you to do this and do that and once you do it is still do not work! The Uber card is a scam! I really didn't want to put a star because it is 0 stars for me.\n",
      "I feel compelled to let people know they are not the only one seeing hidden charges show up after a ride. I recently was in Boston and actually ran down the street to get in the car early so the driver did not have to stop up further in heavier traffic and was charged a wait time charge? How the heck does that work? No response from Uber yet as just wrote to them. The driver was very nice and a good ride to my destination but that fee is so pumped up just to make more money and I was right at the door of the address I put in that Uber agreed to pick me up at for $14 ride.\n",
      "A ride with exact same origination and destination with the similar traffic condition and driver availability situation usually taking around $38 now is being charged around $62, and the driver does not get any of the extra charged amount. UBER is naming whatever price they want without supporting facts, and the customer service is extremely horrible, one of them even marked the issue resolved without any content in reply. Please be caution, don't take the ride if the up front showing price on your UBER app is a rip off.\n",
      "I have honestly lost track of the number of times I have had a frustrating experience with this company. It's got to be at least 10 at this point, within the past year. Each time I attempt to resolve the problem by contacting them through their website, as there is no option to speak with a human being. The process of attempting to communicate with them is, every single time, another giant frustration. I had decided to just stop using their services, as there are many better choices out there (thank you Lyft), but was recently enticed by an email I got offering unlimited $5 rides for a month. I decided to buy the \"pass\" for $5, which would then \"unlock\" the $5 rides. I just arrived home to see that I have been charged $17 for a ride which showed up in the app as being $5. And so I found myself, yet again, writing another disgruntled email, to try to remedy the situation. Please save yourself the trouble and use a different taxi service.\n",
      "I have only been able to successfully use the app once. Whenever I have tried to get a ride it says \"check your connection\". It never seems to have a problem with my connection when it comes to excessively texting me messages, urging me to become a driver or remembering my credit card information. I never requested info to become a driver, only a rider. When I went online to contact \"customer service\", my only option was to fill in a generic field box.\n",
      "It's August 2nd here in Dallas Texas and it is raining very hard. I called for an Uber ride to go to an ortho appointment that I have at Parkland Hospital. I was involved in horrific accident in January and my leg was nearly severed and it was saved from being amputated. I've been in a wheelchair for months today was my first to leave the house without a wheelchair or a walker to go to an appointment. It was pouring rain and the driver pulled up.\n",
      "By far Uber treats there drivers as if they are convicts on bad review or someone does not like you you will be dismissed.  If an incident happens and you try to get information they automatically assume you are guilty.  I was recently sexually harrased by one of my customers while driving I noticed Uber of the situation and they brushed if off basically saying it was my fault and I should have not interacted with the customer.  The immediately deactivated my account without giving me any notification and then stated I was under investigation I called the company and all I got was the run around someone will get back to me.  Then an email stating that my account would be permanently deactivated I was the victim but they want to keep these so called good ratings.  They do not care about there drivers at all beware stay away\n",
      "I had good experience with almost 50% of the drivers but some can be very dishonest. I Had to use Uber a lot during the month of May/June 2017 due to and accident that prevented me from driving._x000D_Case #1: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. He reported we were more than 4 riders. Not true. We were just my husband and I. After many claims from my part Uber eventually refunded me._x000D_Case #2: The driver reported that we changed the destination address. Not true. He charged 100% more of the initial fare. Uber never refunded me._x000D_Case #3: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. She reported that I didn't provide the correct destination address. I explained to her that it must have been a system glitch. I was late for the appointment with my doctor because of that. She reported me to Uber as if I made racial discrimination remarks. NOT TRUE. I contacted Uber and demanded a meeting with the driver to clarify that offensive report. Uber never was able to sustain the driver's claim and eventually they opted to ignore my messages. Very disappointing experience._x000D_I might use Uber in the future but I'll be very cautious checking the charges before I leave the car after the service. And I would advice to customers to do the same.\n",
      "I am an active user of Uber and so, when I saw the service was available in France during my recent vacation, I used Uber rather than a taxi. I left my iPhone in an Uber last Thursday in Bordeaux. I immediately tried to log in to my account and contact the driver but apparently, because I was in another country, they required I provide a verification code - which was sent to my phone, which was in the Uber driver's car. My friend, who is also an Uber user, contacted Uber through her app to file an inquiry on my behalf. We have no less than 10 emails from Uber customer service, a different person each time, asking me/her to file an inquiry online - which would always lead to the service sending a verification code to the phone.\n",
      "In Kadubeesanahalli at 11.00 AM on 31/07/2017, in front of 'Prestige Tech Park' the Uber driver hit my vehicle from right side. I stepped down to find out why he did that. I asked him \"when there is lot of space why you hit my car?\" He replied saying, \"I want to go to the left edge of the road immediately so I hit your vehicle. If I hit your vehicle you will stop so I can go the left edge of the road to drop my passengers.\" This is how the Uber drivers are. Uber is encouraging and teaching their drivers to hit and kill people in order to drop their passengers on time. We are on one way road. He at least does not know that it is one way. He says \"this is two way so I can go to any direction that I want.\" Very strange people on earth. This is how the social responsibility of the Uber is. Great organization.\n",
      "Uber took me to another city 900km away in less than a minute and without me even leaving my home. Got charged more than $200 for a trip that I did not order or took! Never leave your card information in the app, and check the app regularly to ensure you are not a victim of a fraud.\n",
      "Uber charged me 3 times for a trip I took three weeks ago. Then once I wrote into help which was no help they charged me 6 more times and never replied or re-funded me my money. I had to call my bank and dispute charged and ban Uber from taking out of my account They are thief's and hope they do not last long. I have now downloaded Lyft they seem to have better service\n",
      "Uber car service is selective on certain customers in offering flat fare packages deals. If you're a customer that normally spends 15 or more you will never be offered it. I however was accidentally offered it with another 25% off all rides package and when I tried to accept that one it would not let me. I contact customer service they told me to prove it was offered which was really horrible to even go through and I screen shot it and sent it to them. They apologize and said they was sold out and I would receive it on the next month. Not. Again my friend that barely catch Uber was offered it again and I'm with this 25% mess. Uber get lost. They also give one price then when the driver gets lost hike your price. You have to screen shot it before the ride start.\n",
      "Requested a Uber in Las Vegas.  Was standing in front of the Uber designated pickup spot for hotel when ordered Uber.  Contacted driver after waiting 25 minutes.  He said I was at wrong spot hung up on me and cancelled my pickup and charged me.  Uber refuses to refund that charge.  I've contacted them several times and they send me the exact generic email saying no refund.  Horrible customer service will never use Uber again.\n",
      "My first time experience with Uber was objectionable!  Signed up as a first time rider with Uber under a promotion called Chase50.  Offer was for 50% off for first timers for the first 2 trips thru July 31, 2017.  Had a difficult time to get the first one honored and the second one was lamely refused.  Their app is terrible!  It willl not allow a promotion code to be accepted.  Communication thru the app is rigid and tortuous and the usual 800 number in the charges description won't allow any  incoming calls only refers you back to their app which is worthless. And to top it all the second driver's conduct and dress code was second rate to put it mildly.  Thank goodness for Lyft which I have been using all along without any problems whatsoever.  Their driver's professionalism is top rate.   Even their promotions are automatic.  I will erase Uber app not to use them ever again.\n",
      "My uber driver stole my money out of my account. 47 dollars. His name was Michael. License plate **. Be careful he will charge you extra. My ride came up to 7 dollars and they will make up things to take out money out of your account. Uber is very unprofessional.\n",
      "I'm driving for uber, of course as idea uber is a very unique company but bottom line it is taxi company. Only in taxi companies drivers may be non professionals but in uber company I can't see anything that american. Number one being unique company it's not enough to be the great company, and bet is very dirty cheating company, and they cheat not only customers, they cheat drivers, and that automatically mean they cheat government. I warn every customer, driver check your trips mileage and time and compare with charges and you will be surprised that is not matching reality, some small some big but it will be different. Even small different is cheating and if you may multiply that cheating to quantity of trips daily it will be millions, monthly will be billions. Is this is American way? I don't think so.\n",
      "I waited at the same spot at the airport. Car was 7 minutes away. I waited for 15 minutes until the car arrived. Yet Uber charged me waiting time!! The charge was very small but this is a question of principle and honesty. Is this due to improper reporting by driver and if so how can I correct this erroneous reporting. If it is Uber making a mistake how can I get this corrected? It is very difficult to contact Uber about customer issues. I have been an avid Uber rider but from now on I will look for other options.\n",
      "I used the Uber ride and secured Uber pool for the price of $18 and change. When I receive the receipt for the ride it was for $22 and change. I contacted Uber about the error and they insisted the price on the receipt was correct. This was clearly a case of price switching that Uber does not want to take responsibility for. Not to mention that the driver got lost several times using Uber's map system and I had to use the google app on my phone to get the driver pointed in the correct direction. Uber customer service was absolutely no help in this incident at all.\n",
      "I have had several issues with Uber especially their navigation when a 10 minute ride with any other service takes 25 minutes to an hour because of their application. I had my last straw yesterday as I requested an Uber that was three minutes away only to stand and wait for 25 minutes. Of course Uber only gives you two minutes to cancel so almost every time this is the case, the extra charge of almost a dollar is certainly a scam as they probably are adding this to many unknowing customers and making a lot of money on this. I don't always pay attention to the email receipts that come in. \n",
      "I was going on vacation and called Uber, the driver showed up. I opened the door to acknowledge him and start to take out the suitcase. Before I took out the first suitcase the driver left and then charged me a fee. The second driver showed up and said he didn't know how to get to the airport so he too left and charged a fee. Finally I called Lyft and they showed up. However, they kept charging my card while I was in Scandinavia.\n",
      "Driver Gurvinder ( car Tata Indica phone number *******861)in Chandigarh charged me Rs 401.51 instead of Rs 74.27.I entered the correct location and I was following the GPS till the drop off. And I was wondering how the driver changed the location because it was correct till he dropped me off. driver somehow changed it after that and charged me extra. This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Uber at all._x000D_They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs._x000D_That's ridiculous. I have been doing lot of Uber rides but now onwards I want to tell everyone to keep a check on uber drivers in India._x000D_This is very bad experience from uber. I thought Uber drivers were honest - didn't expect this at all.\n",
      "Driver passed me up then showed her on her way back then all of a sudden nothing. By cancelling it wanted to charge me 5.00$. Lost a ton of time and now I have to miss work. Because I didnt pick up my car before closing. Your driver just cost me a days work. Not happy!!! Lic plate#**.\n",
      "First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from UBER.

That pathetic \"HELP\" doesn't help actually._x000D_There were multiple issues I have faced with UBER. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because UBER has only \"HELP\" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this._x000D_This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - UBER has \"HELP\" tab for your security._x000D_I have raised many requests on UBER \"HELP\" till now no help._x000D_One more important thing \"TIME\", nobody cares.

      "We got Uber last night literally 4 miles total. The uber driver was confused since his phone said error and he was like I have never seen that before, we asked him to stop and reset, he didn't as we pulled up to the house it said I was going from Jacksonville Florida to CA and the trip amount was over $5000. I immediately told the driver you need to fix this ASAP. He hit trip end and it showed $7.15 which is still high. I look at my bank account and Uber took out $250, I sent them a dispute and received an email back \"this email isn't associated with your account.\" WHAT??? I have only one email... and proceeded to screen shot everything. I had to call my bank and dispute charges, This is still not resolved and closing my account\n",
      "The company is unprofessional period. They don't care about safety. The people who talk to u sound like they're automated or reading a script. They do not care about u at all.

      "On 07/22/2017 around 11 PM or so, I scheduled an Uber to pick me up for work at 6:30 AM. Now, I have done this many times before when I need an early morning ride. Never had a problem until now, At 6 am on 07/23/2017 I received a text to be ready 5 minutes before scheduled pick up. Next, text was an alert that an Uber driver was 9 minutes away. Then, I received a text message from the Uber driver asking me questions. The first one was \"are you at 349?\" I responded, \"No, 345.\" The next text was where are you going may I ask?\" I stated to work at Meijer on North Weber. The conversation continued. \"You need to cancel cause I am 25 minutes away.\" Now, I am looking at the map and the icon of where the driver is, THIS MAN IS APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILES DOWN THE STREET FROM ME! The driver continues with, you need to cancel right now and you will not be charged. (Lie # 2) I said no not canceling I will be charged 5.00. You cancel.\n",
      "We were visiting Chicago and decided to give Uber a try to get around town. On Monday, 7/17/17, I requested a ride through the Uber app from our hotel to the Roselle Metra train station and Uber responded that a driver was on the way with the make of the car, driver name (Hans), and arrival time of 10:07 am. We waited and Hans did not show up at our hotel, but the app showed he was waiting for us at our hotel and the trip was finally cancelled by Uber and we were charged a wait fee. We had to send another request for an Uber pick up and the driver arrived and got us to the train station, but we were late for the train due to the first Uber driver not showing up at the correct location and had to wait an hour for the next train.\n",
      "Our first trip on Uber (New York) was satisfactory. The driver was prompt and price was reasonable. The second trip resulted in two $5 overcharges after THEY cancelled our ride twice. Reading these reviews shows that overcharging is a common practice for Uber. We found both drivers to be pleasant and capable, and this review is not directed toward them. We will not use Uber again.\n",
      "Your drivers that took me to and from Canoe are either a) stupid b) lying or c) honest that you APP told them to take me MILES out of my way to and from my favorite restaurant. Drive there I was taken through Brookhaven and Buckhead AND she took me on TWO side streets to rack up the miles. Drive back? She told me your APP told her to get OFF the I85 to travel through Buckhead. I had to TELL HER directions so I would not spend the night in her car. I want a FULL refund for both trips. I was 1/2 hour late for my dinner appointment. SCAM! Check out the GPS. Unbelievable. GPS it for yourself. Should I really have to give directions and WTF on the miles?\n",
      "UBER has absolute terrible customer service. Someone hacked my account but fortunately can't charge my credit card. Afterwards, I can't activate my account. After numerous emails with help.uber with numerous useless advices like resetting password numerous time... it is still a NO. After 10 days, my account still does not work and the only way to contact them is via the help.uber service site. The response turn around time is 24 hours. The worst thing is that the responses are robotic and really do not try to solve your problem. I will starting using other car service. Uber should be punished for offering such poor service.\n",
      "I was so upset to see the prices have sky rocketed. I went the first time to National Airport and it was under $30. This last time it was about $36 going to and $55 coming home. I couldn't believe it was so terrible. I liked the drivers and it is not their fault but I can park in a hotel garage for $10 a day and take the shuttle over. I won't use Uber again, unless it is an extreme emergency. Greed is an ugly thing. The drivers aren't benefiting from the rate hikes................ Boo for UBER\n",
      "Today I pick customer up but I wait the 4 minute but he not come out so I did call to him. He not hold the phone so I did cancel it. He come out after I did cancel. I did said call Uber again because I did cancel because rider is no show. He told me that uber is cut money $11 his account. But whenever driver did cancel, uber not pay any money because driver is cancel. I did show to rider I already cancel and I show my account cancel is $ 0.00 so not get any money from customer if I did cancel. Customer need to call uber and refund money.\n",
      "Uber charged me for faults in their mapping system. I was charged Rs.50 in excess when I booked through UberPass. My fault - I asked the driver to drop me at the front gate of my office when Uber mapping system was showing the drop location as the back gate (Exit only). The funniest part is that to reach the back gate I had to go 1 km extra. So I was literally charged extra for saving my time, the driver's time and fuel. I understand that computers can be faulty at times. But when I contacted customer care the human (I assume) gave me the same script. What is the point of having a human out there if they don't understand logic?\n",
      "While staying in Champions Gate, FL, my daughter and friend got an Uber estimate into Orlando at $28 and the return estimate was $28. The first driver took them for the 30 minute drive and dropped them at Church Street after 11 pm. The return driver picked them up around 1 am and brought them back to the hotel 30 minutes and the charge was $63 and stated that it took an hour and 30 minutes. On the map you can see the drive around Buena Vista which was unnecessary. If you know Orlando, you know it's a straight shot on I 4. I drove I 4 that day and there was no construction. It took two emails to get an answer from Uber and they were all over the place with their excuses. Made no sense because it was a straight shot there and a straight shot back. I have used Uber many times but no more. I will use Lyft or go back to old fashioned taxis. How can this business survive with no real customer service?\n",
      "After a night out one weekend, a friend called an Uber for me (because I was pretty drunk, and they wanted to make sure that I got home okay). While in the car, I felt like I needed to puke, so I opened the door and did so outside. NOTHING went inside the car, aside from a few small splashes on the plastic of the door. I offered to go buy a water bottle and rinse that off, the driver said that was fine, and while I waited in line at the store, he took off. Left a drunk 20-something girl on the street, not ensuring her safe arrival home. Both myself and my friend who split the fare with me were charged a small fee - UNTIL our visa statements came where we saw a $75 cleaning fee EACH on top of the ride charge. I spoke to many friends and acquaintances, some of whom actually told me that they puked inside an Uber, and were charged $50. \n",
      "Uber has overcharged $150 dollars for a bogus cleaning fee. I have communicated with them letting them know it was a mistake since we took a very short ride and no accidents happened. They insist that the driver sent pictures for a mess in the back seat and that the charge was valid. There were two of us, we are in our 50's we were picked up at 11:29 pm and dropped off at 11:39 pm. The pictures are not clear, they show white particles on one side of black seat behind passenger seat. They are still insisting the charges are valid and no refund will be processed. Their time stamp on the incident report is 11:26 pm, obviously we were set up by driver. Shame on them, for what I see online this has happened a few times before. I am filing this report for people to be aware of this scam, take pictures before and after when using UBER services.\n",
      "I have been driving for Uber for almost 4 months and never had any issues till recently. I received a rider's request, as we can only see the destination until we start the trip, I get to the pick-up location to find out that the trip is an 8 hours trip almost 9 hours which was from Iowa to Ohio. That wasn't a problem because I needed the money. I started the trip, drove to the destination and completed the trip with 5 stars. Right after completing the rating the app logs me off, suggesting that I get back to my home location for me to be able to go back online. The app froze and there was nothing else I could do in it. The red message suggesting that I go back to my home location was the only thing I could read. \n",
      "On Thursday, July 13th, I received a text from a male driver that he was looking for me and then a voicemail. 45 minutes later, I received another voicemail from a woman saying she was looking for me at a location. I NEVER requested an Uber. I only signed up to this account on Wednesday, July 12th and used the service once to go from the airport to a hotel. Now I have a charge to my account for a ride I did not request or take. \n",
      "I drove for Uber for about two weeks, and it went ok, wasn't making much though. Anyway long story short I am a smoker, and I guess (not knowing it) my clothes had some smoke smell on them, and some people complained about it, so Uber up out of nowhere sends me an email saying I'm fired, I had no idea at the time why, so trying to talk to any kind of intelligent life in the company I finally found out why, but they gave me ABSOLUTELY no warning at all! They never mentioned any complaints until they fired me, and all they do in response is send a pre-typed email to any problems you have. Absolute waste of time, don't ever try this company.\n",
      "I booked a ride the night before for 5:30am  . The driver called at 5:30am and asked me to get another driver, \"You are too far away\". There was no other driver so I missed my airport bus and had to take Uber to the airport 30 minutes later. Cost me an extra $45 which Uber refused to pay._x000D_This is my first disappoint with Uber.\n",
      "Uber is the worst. I call for an Uber, waited at the corner of the street. I saw the car moving on my itinerary/phone and he kept turning around and around. He then stop and walked over to the street. Didn't see him, but saw the car moving and he left. Came over to the side of the street but he never came. We called for another Uber. He came got me and now Uber is charging me $5 for cancellation. I didn't cancel that ride. I stood in the busy streets of Toronto waiting and waiting. He never came for me and they are insisting \"it's accordance to their policy\". UBER SUCK. Pay regular cab rate and get good service.\n",
      "Spoke of how great Uber was but not any longer. After being cancelled on and I was charged then told yes next trip refund $6 that never happened! Again 3 more times since in Atlanta area drivers accept and call but then dont answer when you say hello and I end up cancelling just to reset my phone to try another driver! Airport trips etc. and I was charged again and again without it being my fault what-so-ever! A few are ruining it for the good drivers! Never get my money back! I am done. Will use Cab services from now on and Uber should guard a good thing because with social and reviews, easy come customers and easy go! I work hard for my money too!\n",
      "Trying to get help. On June 29, 2017 Uber started working in Long Island. According to uber if you want to drive you don't need special license special Insurance TLC license, not even a new car 2002 or newer. It sounded really good so I went over to a Marriott Hotel in Uniondale NY and fill out all the paperwork. It was hundreds of people doing it so I was all set to go just wait for June 29 to start driving. With a few days I receive a text from Uber saying going to call him but New York state you need a uber decal. One was already in the mail but in the meantime print a copy and put here in front of my car so I did just like I was told. Runs everything was going smooth. \n",
      "Uber account hacked and they refuse to refund my money. I was out of the country on vacation and someone charged a trip for $37 to my account. I have been arguing with Uber that I was not even in the country and no one else has my account information or access to my phone. I can prove I was not in the country and obviously had my phone with me as I took pictures with it. I am 2 seconds away from canceling my account with them. If I could give them no stars, I would.\n",
      "This is the worst Uber allows their customers to scam the drivers. Drivers will lie and say they weren't picked up and then uber charges back the driver and they have to pay for it. This allows customers to get free rides and this is not fair at all. My advice driver for Lyft, because Uber does not go to bat for their drivers period. I drove a person to a different destination per their request and they contact uber and said \"I never showed up.\" Uber charged me the $20 buck so I lost on the fare and my gas money. This was not right at all.\n",
      "Driver was OK, until we said he was going the wrong way. Then I said \"We are gonna dock you one star.\" Then he said with a whiny voice \"I could lose my job.\" We said \"What destination are you taking us.\" He was not able to confirm our destination. As we were going away from our destination. He was very RUDE and said he was using an Uber app for directions. We said \"Regardless, you are not going the normal route to the American Airlines Area. I go to Miami three days a week. I know how to get there many ways, but not the route you are taking.\"\n",
      "I was returning from a veterinarian's clinic with a very old dog in the back seat.

      "I used Uber 4 days out of the week going to work and going back home. Every time I set my ride Uber charge me a different prices. I'm going to the same place every time so I texted Uber about my fare. Then this morning one of their drivers was disrespectful. I had to call the police on the drive. He threw my personal things in the street like I was dog. While I was talking to the police I told the driver I did not know where I was. This all started over loud club music in the car. It's 5:25 am. I asked him to turn it down. It very hot in the car then the driver said \"you ** this is my ** car. Get your ** ass out of my ** car **\". \n",
      "I have been using the service for the past one year. Your service is very good. Recently one issue is being observed while a cab is allotted for the ride booked. While the cab is already under a trip it is being allotted for the next booking as it is en route and about to complete its last trip. But it is not the case always. On 30-apr-17, when a cab was booked from my residence, the allotted one was somewhere at about 5km away and further 5km yet to go to complete the last trip and then to reach me. \n",

Not happy???\n",
      "Uber gave me an estimate of $17.68 off its app. Driver picked me up, no traffic, he didn't know where he was going, and I ended up getting charged $23.70. That's 33% higher than the estimate. Unacceptable. Next time: Lyft.\n",
      "called for uber to take us to union station from American university section of DC. initial proposed charge was  for $21 then just before pick up got message surge pricing in effect. without proposed charge. agreed since too late to reschedule with other company. pick up was at 9:47 am and there was little traffic. Charge  was $55.82. Fee for larger vehicle to accommodate handicap from Regan airport on return was $34 without tip. A longer trip. Contacted uber which was difficult and no remorse whatsoever. Will never use uber again as no trtust factor at all. Car was mediocre at best. not a accompany to be trusted under any circumstances.\n",
      "Got seriously duped by Uber. Got billed $419 for a trip from Napa to Tracy, CA. Same trip two days ago was $97. They slip the so called Black service under the rug and it is not clear at all that the customer is stepping on a mine with the super high charge. They have been totally unwilling to address that matter and reach a fair arrangement. There have to be consumer protection against such misleading services that differ dramatically in pricing from their regular services.\n",
      "I was a 4.9 rated driver with over 450 trips. Vehicle depreciation, being contractor, dealing with ungrateful/cheap passengers, and fuel expenses were ok to deal with until Uber spent money and lobbied to have warrant checks and fingerprinting eliminated as employment requirement in Houston. Now the market is flooded with druggies, perverts, and criminals. Uber rather have thousands of sub-par drivers than reward good drivers. This keeps the surge down and in theory more people will use the service if the prices aren't surging.\n",
      "Scheduled Uber to take myself and my daughters to the airport. Yes, THE AIRPORT... They cancelled 30 mins AFTER our scheduled pick up time. YOU CANNOT DO THAT! IT'S A FLIGHT! Called a cab, came in 7 mins!\n",

The driver got lost in my complex and it took several minutes by phone to direct her to the correct address. Uber charged me a wait fee! The driver also got lost on the way to destination, which I didn't mind at the time. But now after being charged nearly $11. for a 7.40 ride, it bothers me. They also do not mention or include an order charge of more than $2.00 in the quote that is provided. If I'm being quoted an amount then that's what I expect to be charged. I won't choose to ride with Uber in the future.\n",

      "I booked uber but those drivers told that we are very far we won't come to pick you.up...they suggested me to cancel it and book it again...again the next driver told me the same...

      "I had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation. However, my friend and I called for an Uber...which I highly regret now...that totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible..._x000D_My friend had took my phone to call for an Uber. The Uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination. After waiting around for a bit, we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry. He was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated. Once I told him we were in arrivals, he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride, and Uber had to audacity to charge me for NO service! _x000D_In the normal world, when people arrive at a destination from a flight, they get picked up in \"arrivals\". I tried to contact Uber, but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support. Trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip. All I wanted was my money back, and I probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use Uber if they had simply refunded me....However, they would only give me \"Uber credit\" to use on my next trip and still charged my card. I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was \"against their policy\". _x000D_I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a \"policy\". _x000D_I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation. That simple $5 costs them close to $200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using Lyft and other transportation services instead. My first Lyft ride was really great, the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs!_x000D_Back to the point, Uber is not a good company...there are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers. They prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead. I'm not just referring to the drivers (some have which have been nice to me on other occasions), I'm referring to the corporate dogs that devalue everyone around them.

      "I requested a ride to a medical office that was 0.9 miles from where Uber picked me up. After driving a few miles I questioned if this was correct. I'm not familiar with the area and didn't know exactly where I had to be. The driver pulled into a parking lot and checked her gps and said her Uber app was incorrect. After going 8 or 9 miles I was dropped off at my destination and instructed to contact Uber for a credit. I never tried to change my destination and she always had the exact address. I was charged $20.25 for a ride that should have been 0.9 miles from where I was picked up. After several emails back and forth I am now being charged $15.67 because my ride wasn't timed properly! This is supposed to reflect my proper pick up and destination! If the driver makes a mistake or can't use equipment properly customers shouldn't have to pay for it!\n",
      "Uber offered me 50% off 10 rides thru July 2 however every time I request a ride they make sure to charge me half off of surge pricing no matter what time of day, whether it's busy or not. Basically half off means I am still paying the regular non surge price. What a rip off. And ploy to get money.\n",
      "Their app charges toll when even their driver didn't pay the toll. At time when even the toll plaza is not there, their system charges toll.

I really don't know how I am charged so much & top of that the Uber driver does not have a customer care number & when I told him I would not be giving that money shown he started giving me dhamkis or it can be said that he started talking to me sternly that \"If you do not pay I would not be able to let you down.\" However I gave him the money. This is very much unethical & wanted to say that I need my refund as soon as possible because I have sent innumerable mails to Uber & tried to make calls to the customer care but none of it worked out.\n",
      "I purchased an Uber gift card to be able to get myself around to some very important places that I need to get to such as the doctor's office and pharmacy. Uber prints its store-bought gift cards on cheap, flimsy, unreliable paper. After purchasing my Uber gift card with 50 dollars cash (because my credit card is unavailable for use at this time) I proceeded to scratch off the covering of the code so I would be able to immediately redeem it, apply it to my account. Only when I did the numbers were unreadable, illegible, and part of the gift card paper had come off. There is no way at all for me to be able to read anything under that, it is beyond disgusting and despicable. \n",
      "The driver took ages to approach the location, didn't show up, cancelled my trip.. and then Uber charged me a cancellation fee.

Then received text that he was unavailable, so another being sent. At that point I replied to Cancel, as we had made the bus. Charges were later sent to me. I tried to dispute, but was told that the ride was complete. I replied that someone must have taken the ride, as I had cancelled. They would not refund.\n",

      "I had been a customer for over 2+ years without one complaint or bad review on Uber. While traveling in Mexico I had an extremely awful experience with another customer on Uber Share to the point that the woman was irate and offending me, but Uber decided to cancel my service without even once hearing my side of the story!!!! I contact them numerous times via email until after the 3rd attempt I finally received a pathetic email stating I am no longer a customer. They stated they opened an investigation, but yet will not share any information! If this is how they treat their customers, I definitely prefer to utilize Lyft. User beware of Uber and their horrible customer service. Don't expect them to even hear your side of the story! No wonder they are plastered negatively all over the news for good reason!\n",
      "My husband and I were visiting New York City. We used the Metro and buses most of the trip, but we were going to Carnegie Hall for a concert in the rain. We didn't want to get wet, so we requested an Uber for the first time. We waited where we were told, on the sidewalk, in the rain, with time to spare. When the Uber driver texted that he was there, we didn't see his car at all. We tried waving at people, but we didn't see them and no one stopped. Then, the drive was cancelled by the driver. So, we waited another at least ten minutes for another driver, which ended up getting us there. The next day, I was emailed that we were charged a $5 cancellation fee for the first ride we never took. My big problem is that when I contacted Uber, they did not understand and didn't do anything to fix it. I did not cancel the ride, and we were standing where we we're supposed to. I won't be using Uber again.\n",

When we get to destination my hotel was across the street I asked him to make a U-turn and drop me in front of my location. He told me he wanted to go straight so he wasn't making U-turn. He said he would have to go around the block. I said fine with me. I told him I was going to report him. He then sped up the car to the middle of next block and told me and my child to get out and I did leave without incident.\n",
      "On June 11, 2017, my wife and I attended a Dave Matthews concert in Chicago. Afterward, we were directed by staff security to walk to Michigan Ave. adjacent to the Museum/Aquarium/Planetarium campus to acquire a ride back to our condo as only vehicles leaving the campus would be allowed on the campus roadways. We called for an Uber at 11:06 pm and it was confirmed. We were standing in front of a condo called 1130 - address 1130 S. Michigan Ave. The Uber confirmation indicated our pickup spot would be 1131 S. Michigan Ave. Since there is only a park/greenspace opposite 1130 S. Michigan Ave. we figured the pickup address meant...We had to cross the street! Not an easy thing to do -- Michigan Ave. is 8 lanes wide and BUSY, as you can imagine after a concert with 30,000+ people.\n",
      "I placed an order on Uber Eats app. Less than a second after I placed the order I noticed I had order 3 subs instead of one and I wanted to remove two of those subs and keep only one along with the other stuff I had also ordered. When I call customer service they are telling me that nothing can be changed or canceled because the order was already prepared. In less than a minute from placing the order and calling they had prepared the sub. Yeah right. So pretty much I'm forced to pay for 2 subs I didn't want. And in the Uber app it gives option to cancel or change your order but when you call they tell you no you can't, so I see it as false advertising.\n",
      "Uber has a program called Ride Pass that they have rolled out to a lot of Philadelphians. In exchange of a $20 fee, the user would receive UberPool rides at a flat fee of $2.99 and UberX rides at a flat rate of $5.99 within a designated area for a total of 28 days. The only stipulation, is that if the full value of the ride exceeds $20, the rider must pay the overage. (i.e. if a pool ride costs $24, the user would be charged $6.99). Easy right?\n",
      "I purchased an Uber Smart Pass a week ago and I've noticed several lies within their promotion. When I first purchased it, the app told me that anything under $30 would be covered within the Smart Pass range. Now that verbiage has changed to $20. Also, since purchasing the Smart Pass, Uber drivers have been canceling rides left and right. I've had drivers arrive AT MY APT. and cancel the ride for no real reason. The most annoying part is being charged $5 each time. I can't comprehend why the service charges YOU whenever the driver cancels. That's insane. Charge the drivers for being inept or money hungry for a \"better ride\". Don't punished your loyal customers.\n",
      "I wrote to Uber, \"Your previous drunk driver crashes the car far away from my destination and you still charge me. He leaves me in the middle of nowhere. And again I have to pay more for another Uber which is more far away from my destination and you again charge me for that ride. I kindly ask you refund everything in the scenario where you would have killed someone.\"\n",
      "2 times I had the incorrect fare charged. On 2/14/2017 was quoted a price when I requested ride and was charged double. On 5/31 I went from 12th and Locust to Ivy Ridge Train station. I was quoted $7 when I Requested the ride and was charged $19. It was 11:46 and the driver was Derrick. He had a Volkswagen Routan. He was very Nice. Since this happened twice, I feel that Uber is ripping off many people. The drivers are very nice and friendly.\n",
      "Used twice, over charged twice.    I have used Uber twice. Both times going incoming, I was overcharged from what they stated the charge would be. And trying to get it straightened out, so called customer service kept sending me a form letters  that had nothing to do with my complaint. In my opinion Uber is a scam. Yes you can get where you're going but they charge you at least 20% more then they state their charging.  One time, they charge me three times what they stated they would be charging. It took in excess of 75 emails from me to get that straightened out. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. Uber stinks\n",

      "I use Uber in China, Australia, India and UK and have found them to be reasonable up until now. I took an Uber in Brisbane recently and the driver was terrible. My female companion complained to the driver about his erratic unsafe driving in general, his ignoring of the navigator, ignoring of directions. Uber driver, knowing he would get a one star rating, then complained about us both making 'racist' remarks. I have no idea of what nationality the driver was, it was not even on my radar. My companion sits on University Boards and other Government agencies and is listed in top women business leaders, I also am on similar boards, travel extensively through Asia, Europe and India, we both have no racist comments to make, but we are immediately, according to Uber, guilty. Uber suspends account without discussion with me and then after only sending condescending patronizing emails 'about their community' as they are now also the new warrior and standard setter of community political correctness and protector of multiculturalism, supposedly 'unblocks' my account but it will not work. Despite trying several times to contact them to resolve,  emails are answered, one of our team will be in touch, still waiting. Uber's arrogance knows no bounds, they answer to no one but themselves, they are not only condescending in their attitude, they make public claims which they do not back up.   As they have to answer to know one except their own falsely manufactured 'community' which standards are set by a mutli-national based on profits, not moral or a code of conduct that has checks and balances denying a process for right of reasonable reply nor natural justice to their passengers. Their complaint service is purposefully designed to avoid human contact so they can make their morally one sided incoherent biased judgement in complete isolation and then make unfounded derogatory unable to be replied to judgments that if I knew who it was I would complain to the HRC. As they have no responsibility to local authority nor reasonable codes of contact and conduct, do not expect a fair go from Uber and do your best to out them as a self serving corporate usurer of community standards for their own profit motive while making false claims against real people of high standing in real communities, expose them for the hypocrites they are._x000D_Similar opinion? Write a review!\n",
      "Uber mentions standard upfront charges for their pool rides but if the person you are pooling with cancels the ride, Uber will introduce dynamic charges and charge that extra amount to you. And i guess they even charge the person who cancels. So in a way Uber is making 2 way money. They charged me 3 times the normal charge for a ride where another pooler cancelled the ride. And now they are fooling me saying that since the distance travelled was more than what was entered originally they are charging me more. But actually distance increased because the driver had to pick up another pooler. Now this person didn't turn up. So entire money load comes on me.\n",
      "Last night, I received a text from Uber stating that the email address on my Uber account was changed. Since then, I have not been able to log into my account. The hacker also changed the password. Everywhere I look, it all comes back to having the correct email address on the account. I have tried contacting Uber to resolve this problem - there is no phone number and the given email address does not accept incoming messages. The only way to contact them is to fill in a contact form on their website and hope they call. \n",
      "I am a driver for Uber and noticed I am getting shorted on my pay. I was sent 5 miles to get a rider for a 2 mile ride. Made $2.74. Uber charged the rider $5.96.  Uber took $2.30 for themselves then gave me 75% which made my real pay 46%. Uber cheats their drivers. On the 500 plus rides I've given they have probably cheated me out of a few thousand dollars and customer service is a JOKE!! WORSE THAN Comcast.\n",
      "I was delivering Uber Eats to a client and the client called me a **. Then the client called Uber and lied and said that I had a gun. Uber shut me off and said they were investigating. They didn't allow me to make income through Uber for over 4 days which seriously jeopardizes my living. I am taking legal action, have cut my income when I have done nothing wrong. There is nothing to substantiate their decision except what the client said which was a lie. I have very high evaluations from clients and they have not taken that into consideration. Drive with Lyft and not Uber.\n",

My phone died and shuts down while it was searching for a driver. I assumed that deleted the transaction because the phone was completely dead and off. I decided to walk home. This walk is 30 mins from the train station with some area with no sidewalks. I make a stop at the store half way home. I get home plug up my phone, check the email and see a receipt from Uber. They charged me for the ride as if the driver reported that he picked me up and dropped me to my destination which didn't happened. I walked 30 mins to my front door. I filed a complaint and their response was after review of your account we believe you made this trip. \n",
      "I have booker Uber go cab through Uber application, from my place to Bangalore railway station platform 8. Cab came at expected time around 6pm but later driver stopped the car and he asked us to get down from the car without cancelling the cab. We have to catch the train at 8:00pm. But because of this we missed our train. Uber doesn't have any valid contact number so that we can reach out to them. I have prove of that trip that driver didn't cancelled the cab until 9:30.\n",
      "I ordered a car and was quickly picked up by driver Dramane. When I arrived at my destination I tipped Dramane $8.00 for a $21.81 fare and I left. I immediately noticed that my cell phone a Samsung Galaxy S7 was missing. I called as soon as I could get a valid number from UBER (NO CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SPEAK WITH) AND CALLED. The driver did not answer his phone and after continuous tries he Dramane finally picked up after about 15 minutes of me calling nonstop. I asked him to please look in the back of his car for my phone. He told me \"I have a client and can't\". Bullcrap. He should have done so immediately and from his responses to me I could tell that he was acting very shady. I have no doubt that he did find my phone and kept it. Which means HE STOLE MY CELL PHONE AND UBER DID NOTHING TO HELP ME. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL.\n",
      "Recently use UBER to and from NY La Guardia Airport from my home in Riverdale, NY.  The fare was $17.00 higher on the return trip than going to the airport.  When I complained to UBEr, I was told that 'surge pricing\" applied to my return trip.  Surge pricing is in effect during periods of high demand, high or heavy traffic,or bad weather.  None of these conditions applied.  In fact, we asked the driver upon pick up if it was particularly busy, and he confirmed clearly, it was not;  in fact he said it was extremely LIGHT.  There was absolutely no traffic on the trip from the airport to my home.   Conversely, on the trip TO the airport three days earlier, when my fare was $17.00 LOWER, the driver said traffic was extremely heavy and she took an alternate route to save time.  _x000D_I firmly belive UBER also uses their \"SURGE PRICING\" as a means to increase revenue during normally quiet times, forcing customers to pay higher fares in order to make up for fewer rides requested.  I find this very disturbing and unethical.  Finally, in UBER's response to my complaint, I was told that the fare was displayed before I accepted the ride.  And while this is true, I needed a ride home and price gouging is improper and unethical in any situation.  I am looking into other ride APPS, and will avoid UBER in the future.\n",
      "My Uber account was locked because Uber claims that I have outstanding charges on my account. At this moment, I have 5 supposed outstanding balances on my account from Ubereats. I say that it is supposed because I was charged for all 5 transactions and the money has been taken out from my bank account and paid for. I have been emailing back and forth to Uber about this, but every time it is always someone different replying to me and it is as though they do not even read the previous replies. All they keep telling me is that the charges are legitimate. The first time they told me it is legitimate, then I relied and told them that I was charged and I have my bank statement to prove it, then the next person tells me that it looks as though the charges were disputed and refunded to me, then the next person tells me the charges are legitimate and does not read the previous emails. \n",
      "I do NOT recommend this company. On top of my $33.29 ride, they charged me $250 FOUR TIMES! That's over $1000 for a 10 mile trip! And to make matters worse, it was my birthday and it was ON THE WAY to the restaurant with my wife. There was no damage or anything that we did to be charged this. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER so I have to email them and they have yet to respond and it's been HOURS since I sent the email. I do NOT recommend this company as they are a scam. Just do yourself a favor and use LYFT as I've never had an issue with them. I want my money back, UBER!!!\n",
      "Uber driver, Zlata in New Orleans charge me for a cleaning fee on coffee stains that were existing in her car up on my entrance. No questions were asked, the driver just assumed I made this mess and charge me a $40 cleaning fee. Uber did nothing to assist me in finding the correct passenger and instead still kept the charge on me.\n",
      "I have had so many negative encounters with Uber is not even funny. They took out money from my account several times for trips I didn't take. I used to use them to get to my job and there was always something with them. My last experience I had order an Uber to get to my job. They took the money out of my account. I saw in the map that the driver was taking the trip without me when I had 7mins outside waiting. I called the driver and she hang up the phone. I had to take the bus to work and I was late. Last but not least I got a warning in my job for being an hour late. There was another time they took $88 dollars out of my account for going to NY paying two tolls. When I only took an Uber to my job. I'm done with them. I deleted the app and never again. Lesson learned.\n",
      "Uber first tried to charge me for 2 incorrect rides that I did not take. When I disputed with my credit card company- Wells Fargo - they ONLY removed the rides I did not take. Uber is stating I did not pay for the 2 rides I did take. I sent proof of screen shots from wells fargo site and even spoke to wells 2 times where they say I did pay and it was not retracted. You cannot call Uber and speak to someone. They just keep replying back that I did not pay. I cannot even book another ride.\n",
      "When I used the Uber App to request a ride share from the ATL airport to an address, the economy rideshare quote was $28.76. After I booked the ride, I received notice that I was pooling with someone else, which was expected, but my fare increased to $36.00. Overcharged fare. When I contacted Uber customer support, the computer generated response stated that the fare was correct and refund would be given. When I replied with the attached supporting screenshots of the quoted fare and actual fare charged, I received the same generic information with no mention of the supporting evidence that was included submitted.\n",
      "WARNING: Take a screenshot of the fare you are agreeing with Uber to charge you, you may need it when they change the fare later. Uber increased their agreed to fare with me after the trip was in progress. When asked about it they denied it. Disputing it they then said their driver may not have taken the most efficient route possible. Fact is he did take the most efficient route possible as if that would give them a reason for raising their already agree to fare anyway. I can not trust them and will not give them another chance so you need to know this happens.\n",
      "DO not drive for uber eats as this company has no value for any of it so called Partners. YOu will end up paying uber to drive for them and no profits. in addition you will be stress out because they also want to rate you for a rating system that you have no control over. I started driving for uber because i was recently laid off and needed some income. Like many before me i, fell prey to their deceiving craiglist advertising that  tell you that you could make up to 30 dollars and hour and that it was a fun no boss way to make money. DIN\"T even come close to making minimum wage and in addition at the end of the year when i file taxes was told that i owed 1500. dollars. for taxes. SO after taxes, oil change, Gasoline, tires, and i ended up with nothing. I also tried their UBer eats was far more worse. I was waiting for over two hours to get a precious beep and after getting beep went up four set of stairs and customers don't even give you any tip. delivery fee was only 2.30 cents so after two hours. THis is what i made. In addition i did twenty hours for uber eats and made after gasoline 100. dollars far less than the minimum wage. DO NOT GET Deceived by their false adds to be your own boss and make as much. They control everything, from rating, to how many beeps, you get to tipping option which they still haven't added to their app. DO YOUSELVES  a favor stay away from UBER EATS.\n",
      "Uber did not record a trip I made as a driver. I reached out to them with specifics of the trip I completed and they basically said if I didn't have exact records of the trip they couldn't prove I made the trip and didn't provide me with an explanation as to what could've happened or who I could reach out to to file a complaint. I signed up with Uber because I thought it would be convenient not to drive people around for free. Very disappointed. If you choose to drive with Uber be sure to screenshot or document your trips because if your money goes missing they will not help you!\n",
      "Most of my Uber experiences have been good except....driver cancels and then there is a price surge.  Yesterday I was quoted 23 dollars and then the driver took his own crazy route and the bill is 38 dollars.  I also got ripped off when a driver went the wrong way.  Is this normal?\n",
      "First, my complaint is Uber REFUSES to call anyone so you can have a conversation about your dissatisfaction. Second my complaint is that they are running a bait and switch that is unethical. My TRIP: THE ISSUE is that their app told me I could USE UberX for a trip from the Indianapolis airport to my house in Cincinnati and the fee would be $115. I checked it 3 different time during the week to confirm the rate wasn't a error. When I got to the Indy airport from FL I checked it again and the app said my cost would be $115. WHEN the driver showed up tells me that I can't use UberX but had to select UberXL because of the distance of the trip.\n",
      "My name is Scott and my husband was working for Uber. He had a ride with 3 people in it. When they got in they had a metal smoking pipe that they put out on the hood liner of my car. The pipe was left in the car and a burn hole in my car. He sent pictures to Uber and they said that they needed a quote. So the first quote we got was almost $2000 from Chrysler since that's my car. We only received the quote over the phone. It was too far away to drive so we called Chrysler near us. They referred us to a person that gave us a quote of about $300. He sent the quote to Uber and they got back to him today.\n",
      "The idea, service and my experience as service is ok._x000D_But sadly the app, have thousand of errors, small issues_x000D_and not as good. i put down 2 stars as the app works just _x000D_on google maps for me.\n",
      "I'll start by stating in New York uber has the most laziest drivers, more lazy and un- compromising than average crappy cab service. In my experience drivers refuse to contact their customers, they lack any ounce of hospitably, Ive seen cabs on my map literally pass right by me, are too lazy to find me or even make a U-turn. Despite the address I input some drivers will get lazy and drop me off at the wrong spot or a block away from my stop. Some drivers are either to old, lazy or stupid to know how GPS works, which cause locations errors most driver do not want to make up for, for a lot of errors drivers make I \"the customer\" have to compensate for. Uber's refund system is a joke! If a driver cancel a trip the cancel fee comes out of my pocket! And when I report it they give me credit (not an issue) but I want my real money they toke back! Their rating system is adorably useless, because regardless how many one stars a driver gets whats the point if you can't report the driver on their $#*!ty service or better, make a complaint, I've seen drivers that treat me like crap with five or four stars!?. I'm from NY and a lot of drivers are not American therefore theres a big broken English barrier, try explaining a location to someone who doesn't understand you or vice versa. The only reason I ever use uber is literally because Lyft has error issues on my phone, Lyft is also cheaper with nicer drivers, while uber is the Kwik-E-Mart of cab services. Ubers only good for drunk or lazy riders who don't understand good customer service.\n",
      "My Uber Account was hacked today. Uber does not have a customer service line that you can contact. I was unable to log into my account to remove my payment information due to the hacker changing the email and password onto my account. Uber's site says to send them an email and someone will contact me within 24 hours. That's not acceptable. I've had to cancel my credit cards right before Memorial Day Weekend which doesn't make for a pleasant holiday. Thanks, Uber, for your ZERO customer service. I just want everyone to know that there is NO one to call if this happens to you.\n",
      "I always had a good drive with the uber. But today morning I have my exam from 9. I call the uber driver before 35 mint so that I can reach early.. And he revived my call and told me he will  reach within 5mint I waited for him for 20 mint and the driver didnot turned up and I literally missed my exam.. please select some professional driver or else it will be a great loss for the Uber company.. (*******824) this driver should need to learn a lesson.\n",
      "I am wondering if all the Uber drivers are given the ability to actually fire clients... making it so that they and their families can no longer use the Uber service and on top of that... rob that person of $50? There were 2 cancellations on this evening both by the same driver in the same hour. On this night my 18 year old son (who had struggled from kidney failure since birth and whose growth was somewhat stunted) was hanging out with friend at the \"sci fi factory\" near Keller TX was ready to walk the 1.5 miles home when I told him just to wait and I'd get him an Uber. The Uber driver pulled up... took one look at my son and screamed \"you have to be 18 to ride!\" Then he pulled away leaving my son standing there. Never asked for ID... never even gave me a call! \n",
      "I spent over an hour of my personal time seeking the lowest fare to the airport following meetings in Grand Rapids, MI. I'm a government employee, and every dollar counts. Out of over 30 options reviewed, UBER was by far the cheapest at $16 from downtown. Next best was $20, and then the others hovered around $35-45. Google revealed the secret technique on how to preorder a 5:15am Uber the night before._x000D_Out of the shower I spy a circa 5:15am. text that, due to SURGE PRICING, my 5:25am fare would now be 3.5x what we had agreed to the previous evening, and I had 5 minutes (already spent in the shower) I could cancel without being charged a fee. The soonest cab ($40 fare) was 20 minutes away that I couldn't spare at this point. My $16 deal now cost $51. Cancelling Uber at this point would mean a missed flight, lost connections and expensive misery. There was nothing to do but pay whatever they asked. Sort of like breaking down in the middle of nowhere with the only mechanic being the crooked Sheriff's brother. Well played Uber! Well played! I can't help but think this is a frequently used well-planned scenario or else they would have made me aware of this surge thing the night before being a possibility.  Had they done so, I would have used a stable priced cab service. I shall never use Uber again. They not only screwed me, but all the transportation providers that were cheaper than $50. I also am left with a bitter taste of my Grand Rapids experience although everything else during my visit was superb. I will never recommend Uber to a friend or worst enemy. NONE OF THIS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY DRIVER. She was great.\n",
      "This is a reasonable service.  However, they intentionally DO NOT have a way to reach the service or the driver.  As a result if you've forgotten something you're out of luck.  For example, my dealer uses Uber.  The driver was quick and efficient.  As I got out of the car and thanked him, he drove way.  No problems,  but just then I patted myself down and realized by bluetooth  (with charger) had fallen from by pocket.  I could see him driving down the hill but he did not see me.  I quickly asked the service manager to call the Uber driver (thinking I could catch him before he turned onto the main road.  NOPE!  We don't know how, after 45 minutes of keystone copism I have an email to a Brittany.  No phone number and then after much research if find out there is NO phone number, intentionally.  So, while I tried the \"contact us\" mode that didn't work.  and it turns out Uber is satisfied with not hearing from it's customer in the event they REALLY need to be reached.  Caveat Emptor!\n",
      "I noticed that the reviews for Uber were low on this site so I felt compelled to share my positive experiences with readers. My husband has been using Uber for quite some time because he does a lot of traveling with his occupation. We used Uber together on our trip to San Juan Puerto Rico recently and every ride was 5 star and top notch. The drivers were friendly and professional. All of the vehicles we rode in smelled fresh and clean. We actually had a taxi driver harass one of our drivers and although we had our Uber driver pick us up at the business next door to our hotel, the taxi driver could tell it was Uber because my husband had his phone in his hand & we waved to the Uber driver. I can honestly say that due to the taxi driver scaring me by bullying our driver, I will NEVER take a taxi again as long as I live. Last I checked, we live in a capitalist society and competition is good for us. Taxis should not have a monopoly! I highly recommend Uber.\n",
      "Uber gives men a chance to cheat on there girlfriends or wife's. I've had it happen to me and know other women it's happened to. The guy would say I'm doing uber but really he's going to meet another women. So be care other women out that you boyfriend or husband is really doing uber and not out cheating on you. I think uber is ruining lives and destroying relationships. I think uber should be a schedule hours and should be online so many hours before getting paid or something to ensure men won't cheat.\n",
      "I started driving for Uber because of the referral bonus. Figured why not drive and I get 300 dollars and my friend who referred me get 300 dollars. Fast forward me completing the 40 drives they tell you to make in a month, in a week and they say that, \"We didn't mean the money was a bonus on top of the money you made. We meant that you were guaranteed to make 300 dollars giving 40 rides.\" Of course I was. That's no incentive. Lyft pays out the 300 dollars the moment you complete the trip. I complained about this stating I do not want to work for a company with such bait and switch practices and instead of resolving the situation they deleted my driver app and my rider app and didn't even let me cash out the 100 dollars I made that day.\n",
      "I open account with Uber company to be easy for to use a car service. In less of month I got in my check account more of $200.00 in charged for ride with Uber. I tried many time to contact with them, but, the only way by messages (taking long time) and coming with the questions and nothing to solution my complaints. I called my bank and closed my check account!!!\n",
      "I just want to highlight the inconvenience that has been provided by your company app to my friend: Apoorva **, her account has been blocked since a week now and we both have been trying to get in touch with your company via email and all we get in reply is that your system raised a flag and blocked us. Lol. \"FLAG just because we were updating email address.\" And you want us to also \"Appreciate your understanding in this regard.\" - LOL. We have all our invoices blocked in that account. Hence it's a request if someone with some logical sense can have a look at her account and get it sorted for her. Systems can do errors, but who accepts their mistakes these days. All we want is our invoices and we will make sure never to bother Uber again for any ride. Ola is way more better with respect to quality app. \n",
      "Why do you continue to overcharge rides and call it a cancellation fee. I never moved from my original site. Uber driver stopped several blocks away, then turned around and left and stuck me with a $5 cancellation fee. He cancelled me, not me cancelling him.\n",
      "I use my corporate card for business trips when I use Uber. My company told me I have a charge for $3.80 that I need to show proof for so I went to my Uber app and seen that I never took a trip on that date. I reached out to Uber and explained to them that I was charged but never took a ride. The first response was someone telling me to send my bank statement and they will be happy to reverse the charges. I asked my job to provide proof as I don't get statements because it's my corporate cards.\n",
      "We ordered Uber XL for our party of five. A Toyota 4Runner was assigned. It did not have seating for five plus a driver. We had to cram four in the backseat. Several emails between Uber and myself resulted in a \"too bad, it's what you ordered.\" So we paid premium rate for a service we did not get. Uber XL says parties of 1-6, but beware. You are responsible for knowing if the vehicle assigned will seat the number in your party.\n",
      "Had good experiences with Uber of late.  The website and app are wicked.  Easy to use, customer journey is great and the cabs are on time and all the drivers so far have been brilliant.  THanks Uber\n",
      "As a transportation planner the Uber business service comes in handy.  The issue is that not everything is the same.  Some vehicles are new and some drivers are great then some vehicles are old or drivers get lost.  But this is part of the experience\n",
      "Uber, for JFK your pools should only be with other at airport passengers going to Manhattan. Not take an airport passenger in a local passenger only going 2 miles adding 45 minutes to the trip to get off the main route to the city.\n",
      "I am an Uber driver. I want to comment. I try not to cancel. I have had plenty of riders when I show up at their destination are not ready. I usually call them after 5 minutes, most of the time they are on their way and I wait. I have had some whose phone goes to voice mail and I waited a few more minutes they come or they don't so I cancel. Uber drivers do not get paid if they wait after 5 min and the rider cancels which has happened to me, which pissed me off, especially when it is a long trip. Riders need to be outside on time or call the Uber driver. I have never canceled due to a destination, but better yet, who wants to maybe drive as I did a long distance and upon arriving have the rider cancel and don't get paid. No excuse.\n",
      "I recently booked a Uber and I had to catch a train. The driver agreed to come and I continuously called him and directed my location. After 30 mins waiting for him, he cancelled. I have missed my train too. Uber charges for cancellation every time but what about the time when the customer suffers for driver's cancellation. Who is going to refund my amount. Uber is the worst experience I had and this continues to happen every time I ride with them.\n",
      "My family recently visited NYC and my dad has had great luck using Uber in other cities in the past, so when we couldn't get a cab easily, we took Uber quite a few times over our 3 day trip. Some trips were great, some were just okay, but one of them was beyond bad. We were traveling from near Times Square to Battery Park (we had reservations to be on Ellis Island at a specific time). We selected Battery Park as our drop off point, and told it to our driver again when we got in the car (the dirty, smelly car).\n",
      "Driving for Uber is simultaneously good and bad. Pay is constantly fluctuating. Very unstable. $600 one week, $350 another week working same hours. They let anyone be a driver so there are more drivers now then there are rides available. Very incompetent system no way of contacting support except email or from app by selecting specific problem and even then they respond with an automated message based on problem. They do not help with maintenance or gas. A few cents off their gas credit card. Big whoop still spending $80-$100 a week on gas to drive full time and 6,000+ miles a month. And the service is way too cheap a measly 65 cents a mile and 11 cents a minute in my area with customer always wanting to make extra stops and screwing me out of my time. And they encourage people not to tip. Even for Uber eats I wait in long line and bring food to your door for $4 and no tip? Waste of time and destroys your car. Only good to make extra spending money not full time. Not to mention some customers are petty and will leave bad ratings for something like dirt on the floor. Ok 10 other people were in my car today how would I not have dirt, part of which is from you? I have time to vacuum after every ride? They expect so much out of a taxi service. Even had people complain that I didnt have the wireless Aux for their iphone 7 are you serious?\n",
      "After reading reviews by other disgruntled customers, I can see that my experience is unfortunately normal. _x000D_I arrived at Manchester, UK airport around 10:30 pm and used the app to contact a driver. The app showed the driver was 3-5 minutes away but I waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled. Part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasn't easy to be met. However, I didn't receive a call and when I tried calling I didn't get an answer. _x000D_I didn't give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didn't help. On one of the ride requests I cancelled within 5 minutes. Now back at home I see that Uber charged me $5 US for each cancelled ride, even the one I legitimately cancelled._x000D_I'm glad there's a forum like this to lodge a complaint but would prefer the message reached a wider audience since I now have read that Uber was given an F by the Better Business Bureau. The public should know they are scam artists !\n",
      "The driver pulled up and said they were cancelling my ride to the airport. The next driver informed me that they probably had a higher fare at the last minute as my fare was only $6.00. I then get charged a $5 fee? I asked for a refund to my card, but all I received was template responses stating that they will only issue a credit to my account and cannot refund to my card. I cancelled my Uber account and my wife and daughter did as well. Hope you enjoy the $5.00, Uber!\n",
      "I have made 3 attempt to sign up to NO avail. I fully admit I am 73 but I can easily call a cab using the Web. I think and can only assume all will agree that the system should be user friendly. No wonder they have so many poor reviews.\n",
      "I have $150 in Uber credit and have been trying to get a ride for over a month. Every time I try to arrange for a ride I get an error message. I've been hoping to get some assistance from Uber support staff but after almost 35 emails I still can't use the service and they refuse to refund my $150. They keep thanking me for my patience, but I'm all out of patience. I've also literally spent days trying to get some assistance, or maybe a ride? Their customer service is nonexistent and amazingly frustrating.\n",
      "I am very frustrated with Uber. 2 days I missed my bus because of Uber and their foolishness beyond my control and I want my money back. I am dissatisfied with not being able to talk to 1 person instead of 3 and 4 different people by email through the Uber app. Ridiculous!!!! This all started last Friday 5/5, I requested Uber at 6:28, my Uber took a few min. but Pineda came at a reasonable time. My stop is 5-6 min. from my house but the stupid Uber app told the driver to go in the opposite direction to get the other rider 15 min away and therefore made me miss my 7 am bus. So I then had to take another Uber because the next bus was 7:35 and that would have made me even later for work. Not only that but I have taken this ride several times and it cost $6, why was I charged $9.30. The receipt even says $6.26. So now I have to request another Uber to get me to the train. That was another charge but it looks like they took care of that one from Friday. \n",
      "I decided to try Uber Express Pool after work because of its advertised lower fares. I scheduled for an Uber Express Pool on Monday at 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm with a fare for $3.75, which is pretty decent. I had no issues. Because it went so well, I decided to schedule an Uber Express Pool again after work on Tuesday for the same time, 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm. Surprisingly, it was the same price, $3.75. When I finally got dropped off home, I received an email receipt saying I was charged $20.61 for surge pricing, booking fee, the distance and time it took to drop me off. \n",
      "I have had a few issues with Uber in the past few weeks and overall, I am disappointed because I feel that my time and money are valuable and this is not being respected by Uber. The most recent issue was yesterday, when I ordered UberPool, however was charged an UberX fee. If you look at my past ride history, I am well aware of how to order Pool vs UberX. The same thing happened to me on 5/1 (UberX instead of Pool), however I believed it was my mistake and did not say anything. Yesterday, however I was very careful. The difference between Pool and UberX is significant and I am frustrated that I have paid so much extra, for no fault of my own. What is worse is that when I wrote to Uber Support, I was given a generic reply where they had not even attempted to fill in the automated blanks, and they would not respond to my messages.\n",
      "I booked an UBER x car from Grand Central to Bed-Stuy and was quoted about $23. Driver was on his way and I got a text that said the fare changed due to increased demand. There was no other information on the app on the fare increase. I texted the driver and asked how much the surge was. He texted \"2.2\" which I thought was $2.20 or about 10%. I got a receipt for $67.00!!! Or 2.2 TIMES the fare. Numerous emails late and they only want to give a \"Courtesy credit\" of $18, still paid $50 for the fair quotes at $23.\n",
      "I ordered a ride to get to work, the ETA said 15 minutes. The driver showed up in 8, and while usually that would be seen as a positive thing, I was not ready to leave yet since I thought I had 7 more minutes. Uber has a feature where the driver cancel the trip 5 minutes after arriving at the destination and it automatically charges the customer $5 even though no service was provided. This happened to me all within the 15 minute time frame I originally agreed upon with the initial Uber request. It's only $5, but it's a matter of principle. On top of this, their customer service is nearly non-existent as they don't even have a phone number to discuss this with anyone. You can only correspond through email which is very impersonal and a massive hassle. I cannot believe how shady they came across with this. \n",
      "I own my car... never rode with Uber. I have been charged through my card and email address with my card in my possession. I have not been able to contact a live person with different attempts. My son living in another city with his email address and my card numbers with no history and no Alert to my address... All of this has been reported to no avail. To ride Uber and never have, I have tried emailing with no response. They have my and credit card information. They have recorded my son's name, address in another city, with my credit card info... with no travel history that we can see and I haven't receive an Alert on my PC. This information has been reported... with no results... No live contact.\n",
      "I live in Europe and I've started using Uber as I was traveling through middle and south america. At the beginning everthing was fine and I thought it was a great service but sadly I was proven wrong! As I wanted to go from Meddelin city colombia to the airport to take my flight to panama city, panama... I used the Uber App for the transfer and the price that was shown to me on the App was approx. $25. It was $5 more than what I've paid for a normal Taxi coming from the airport to Medellin city but I was in hurry so I took the offer. After I've arrived at the airport though I've noticed that $45 were booked from my cc by Uber for this ride, so I did what everyone would normally do and that is send a complaint to Uber about the overcharge. I did this using the Uber app. Anyhow two days later I've received an email from Uber and I couldn't believe what they wrote to me.\"Your account has been permanently suspended\". So they have suspended my account permanently for sending a complaint via their App. Can anybody believe this? Well after seeing what United Airlines did to one of it's customers nothing should shock us anymore! But all I want to say here is.. we all need to always look for and use alternatives. These big companies need to have as much competition as possible otherwise they will grow arrogant and start treating their customers like trash.\n",
      "I tried unsuccessfully to get a ride with Uber. My first driver cancelled on me without an explanation. My second driver took twenty minutes to try and find me, but could not because of road closures (Lyft was able to find me just fine by using a traffic app). Uber charged me a cancellation fee for the second trip and now refuses to refund me despite it being their fault. The driver told me to cancel!!! Uber's customer service is only through e-mail, so they sent me abrupt e-mails refusing to refund me and closed out my ticket.\n",
      "First time using this company and last one. Uber has a glitch in the system and the driver was directed to another address. I called him and he refused to come to my pick up location and Uber charged me $5 fee for canceling. I ordered the same service for a second time. The same driver and the same issue. He was sent to another place. I had to walk one block. Upon arrival he showed me Uber sending him to a place that I did not request.\n",
      "I have been in contact with Uber several times on different matters, one of them being that I had purchased an Uber gift card and was using it for my rides, uber charged my credits on my account and also charged my bank account. They had returned most of the rides back to my account except one. No matter how many times I have contacted them, they still have not given me back my money. I also had an issue with a gift card that had been purchased, it did not make it into my account and no matter how many times I contact them using their email helpline, they still have not put it on my account. It just turns out that the service is not worth all of the trouble, no phone number, no customer.\n",
      "Had to walk, why would I ever try and contact Uber again?  I'm happy for the people who use and save money instead of a taxi. Stupid.\n",
      "I'm informing you of some issues that are occurring while using these services. My girlfriend uses uber 5 days out of the week to go to both her school and her work each day. However, we have noticed more lately that the uber drivers keep canceling the rides. It will say they are arriving in 13 mins or however far they are then when they get close they cancel the ride so we request another trip but no 1 is available or it takes up to 15 or sometimes 20 mins to even get another person to accept the request.\n",
      "Today I booked with Uber and when the app showed our car was  due in 5 minutes, we went downstairs to wait.  30 minutes later we were still waiting.  During that time, the estimate of arrival bounced back and forth between 3 minutes and 11 minutes.  We gave up when it became clear that we  would not be picked up in time to reach our destination before it closed.\n",

      "Do I have to give them \"One star\"?? I had tried to schedule the ride thru the Uber app and it said the request had failed and was not scheduled.The app would not let me redo the ride request, so I went and ordered a ride from Lyft. The driver from Uber showed up so I took the ride and had to cancel the Lyft ride, which I was charged $5 for canceling. I would like to be credited the five dollars I had to pay for the Lyft ride I had to cancel.\n",
      "I was picked up for a ride to the Atlanta airport on 4/27/17 in what was supposed to be an UberX. Uber's stated standards for an UberX are a 4-seater car. But I had to ride in the FRONT SEAT of a teeny-tiny, red 2-seater. I had to hold my luggage on my lap because it was so small. And worst of all, it was driven by somehow who didnt know how to operate the GPS. He said, \"Sorry I dont know how to use the updated system.\" For more than half the ride, the GPS kept trying to redirect us back to my house (the starting point). I was having to try to figure out how to operate the system for him. Which is not what I paid for! It was incredibly stressful.\n",
      "I just wanted to know why Customer Rating is displayed on Uber app... What it is related to... So based on this rating, do drivers have authority to cancel our booking?? Or just to show customer that you have to keep quiet if at all you are unsatisfied with the experience... I mean we should give a rating of 5 to all drivers so that they should give us a rating of 5... From my point of view, customer should have a chance to rate a driver as it can be useful for other customers while selecting a cab... But in this case, I just wanted to know why you are providing drivers to rate us... So in this case, as how Uber drivers will be asking us to give rating of 5, we should also ask them to give rating of 5... So do I mean it correct?? \n",
      "Simple, easy and I love the app. I can't live without it. Much easier than trying to find a normal cab.\n",
      "I am attempting to become an Uber driver. When trying to update my profile, I get a message \"please wait\" with the spinning circle and it never connects on three different computers. I called several times on two separate numbers, left messages asking them to call and they never did. Uber website is also not very intuitive or friendly._x000D_I am also working on Lyft, so far so good, their website works, at least. At this point I say stay away from Uber.\n",
      "So I am away in Vegas and I called an Uber for my daughter in Los Angeles to pick her up at school and take her home. I've done this tons of times with Uber. The school 10 minutes or 3 miles away. It is straight down the street. So I see a charge for 12 dollars and I look and I see the Uber driver picked up my daughter, drove past my house and took her 20 minutes out of the way and then took her back home. So I say that has to be a mistake. I dispute it. No way a 10 minutes ride is more than 10 dollars and I picked a Uberpool so no more than 6. The driver picks up a second person DOWN THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE and goes and gets on the freeway. My daughter let him know he's going in the wrong direction and he still take the second person home and then bring her back. Making a 10 minute ride 30 minutes.\n",
      "Multiple experiences with Uber India via email has convinced me that their staff's competence, training level provided to them by Uber India and their internal group who frames processes for non US countries SUCK BIG TIME. I have used them in the US sparingly mostly to & from airport trips. Never had an issue with promptness, billing and quality of ride. Ride quality - one expects clean vehicles on pricier rides. Nopes. Many stink worse than a public transport. Billing - despite using same credit card on multiple previous occasions, I am told they can't charge it on some of the rides.\n",
      "I contacted Uber and driver canceled late with me causing me to miss my appointment that he was to take me to. I took a taxi at the last minute but was still too late. Wish I had called a taxi to start.\n",
      "I drove for Uber for about 4 months in Tucson. Riders are a bunch of crybabies who will leave a 1 star review if you don't let them drink their coffee in your car. Uber has fostered this mentality with its feedback system giving the rider a disproportionate amount of power. It was common for a rider to be disrespectful or abusive. Riders Never tip. Getting paid 95 cents per mile is nothing for what you put up with: traffic congestion, unreasonable riders, canceled rides, wear and tear on your vehicle, increased insurance rates, long waits at the airport, drunk riders, etc. \n",
      "Been charged extra ride. Not one spot. 10 time is hilarious disgusting and I'm professional. When I look at my bank statement overcharge me many times in one day. From 7 to 10 charges to my debit card value of almost $300. I new to Uber and I'm very dissatisfied with this. Outcome are usually much every trip I make with my banker. Stay mad. But when I see you there I'm charging just one day 5 to 10 times. It's very unfair to me. Sorry I will never use Uber again.\n",
      "I had requested a pickup and app showed 3 minutes, then 6 minutes, then 7 minutes so I cancelled and decided to get the bus. While waiting at the bus stop about 5 blocks away, the driver called and said he was there. I told him I left but he asked me to wait for a couple of minutes. Despite the fact that the bus was only 5 blocks away, he couldn't find me. My dumb decision as I let two buses pass by and as the 3rd bus arrived, my driver pulled up and told me he found me because of the passenger in the car. The first thing was that the driver was new, ok no problem, but the car had the overwhelming smell of flowers that you couldn't breathe. Then he took me on a circuitous that resulted in me being trapped in downtown traffic the complete opposite of my direction. \n",
      "I made an Uber reservation and after waiting for several minutes, the driver never showed up and then he cancelled the trip. I have 2 issue here: On top of this, Uber charged me with a cancellation fee, how ridiculous. I then again tried to reserve a ride, and now they charge me with $33 more with a reason of high demand. This seems like an on-purpose rip-off or a fake demand created. Will never use UBER again.\n",
      "Driving for Uber was a bad experience. There is one enrollment office in South Florida and you are treated like cattle. When you become a driver, your app does not always work. There is no follow-up system that allows review of drives completed and so verify your earnings. Phone calls are not answered and messages are not returned.\n",
      "I had to catch a flight  from delhi so I called uber to my location but I don't know where the driver reached and he didn't even called me to ask my location instead I had to call him back when he tooked so long ,since I was getting late for my flight so I need to cancel the booking. And now I need to pay the cancellation charge when it wasn't even my fault.\n",
      "Try cancelling your account and find big surprises.  Some of my friends thought they had cancelled their accounts along with their Credit card info.  However, after hearing my problem, they checked with Uber and surprise!  CC info was still there and accounts not closed.  Here is what happened to me.  i decided to use only the cash feature and delete my CC number.  They told me I could not even though other friends have signed up for and used the cash only option(may not be available everywhere, i guess).  After several days of back and forth emails to Uber I was finally told that I had 2 different accounts with 2 different CC's. one as a driver and one as a customer.  I find this interesting as I don't have a Drivers License or CC, only a debit card.  I am retired from Walt Disney!  It is just a on-going mess,  Consumers beware!\n",
      "The other day I took Uber to my physical therapy appointment. I go using Uber every two weeks. I have been using Uber for this for about a year. I go to my appointment and return straight home. This time I was overcharged by more than $12 dollars. Uber claims I changed my destination on the return trip to my home. Obviously the driver neglected to report I had reached my destination before he continued to his next location so I was charged for those miles. Uber refuses to acknowledge the error and after numerous emails only respond with the same canned response. They won't even check with the driver or my trip history. And no phone number to speak with a live person. They don't care about their customers. I am switching to a different company.\n",
      "In suburban Tampa, we requested a car to Tampa International Airport. The driver, Lillie, was totally rude and incompetent. The vehicle had her own personal luggage in the back, so there was no room for ours. Her comment, in barely understandable English, was that we should have said the ride was to the airport.  Duh. Apparently she did not know that Tampa International Airport is an actual airport.  She slammed the door and yelled that we would have to call another Uber. If you need an Uber in Tampa, be sure you don't get Lillie.\n",
      "After using Uber (linked to Paypal), my Uber account was hacked. I received a text message in a Russian language. If I'm in Florida, how can I be using Uber in Russia? Hello. Next two large charges appeared on Paypal. Paypal immediately rectified the situation and imagine that they actually provide a phone number where you can call them! Uber. No. The hacker changed the name on my account and password so I can't log in. I've made 10 attempts to get this fixed - to no avail. Uber won't let you talk to anyone. And if you can't log in, you're hosed. My credentials have been compromised and they could care less. I can't even cancel the account. UBER BEWARE. What a scam operation. Guess my next steps will be an attorney.\n",
      "I requested a ride via Uber last week while I was at the San Diego Padres stadium with my kids. The driver assigned to me claimed erroneously that \"roads are closed\" and simply gave up. Roads were not closed. No attempt to establish a separate meeting place. I suspect they got a better offer on another ride and ditched us. Took a real taxi cab and got to where I needed to go. I then found Uber tried to charge me $5 for the \"experience\". I disputed the charge and got that taken off my credit card. Not paying a penny for botched service. I will never bother with Uber again, period. You may pay more for a cab, but it's worth the added investment to ensure their commitment to pick you up will actually be honored and carried out professionally, unlike amateurs off the street.\n",
      "This happened in Washington DC, need to get to the airport. Uber driver arrives, sees me and my family, kids, then leaves inmediately, without even saying why. Uber then charges me a $5 cancelation, charges me!!!. I don't know what to do, really need to get to the airpost, so I request them again. Another driver arrives, and does exactly the same thing. Uber does exactly the same thing of course and charges me another $5. What is this?. On top of all that, no way to contact them, worst service I've seen in my entire life._x000D_Of course I am fighting them and I will get my money back one way or another._x000D_Stay away.\n",
      "I have never used this company but I magically got a charged from them at 4 in the morning when I was still in bed a sleep. It was a headache I went back and forth with this disrespectful company all day long trying to figure out where my card was used. But they had not will to help me, no matter how many times I told them I have no account with them they kept asking for my account information with them. I think it is so wrong they will protect thieves that work for them and won't do a thing about it.\n",
      "If you are thinking of making extra money with UBER, think again! It is impossible to contact them, no phone, no direct email. I drove a rider; Uber's app is difficult to navigate, it didn't register and afterwards they said the rider canceled!! So even though I did pick up and deliver, I did it for NOTHING!! Now who can I complain to?\n",
      "I was charged a cancellation fee by a driver I never requested. I was already in vehicle with a driver who was completely confused because the requested Pool had him pick up 2 people from same location. I send Uber a message explaining this and they issue me a $5 credit to account. NO, I want a $5 credit back to my bank account! It may seem petty to some but I control my funds not Uber or anyone else. I explain to them I want refund to my account and their response that in accordance with their cancellation policy it can only be credited to my account, I've looked at the site and there is nothing that visibly shows cancellations are only credited to accounts. And if I'd known about this policy I would've discontinued use with Uber long time ago. \n",
      "While leaving Coachella festival on Sunday we were required to first go through the app and we would receive a 6 pin code to give to the driver. While he wouldn't give me his name I was able to get his license plate number California plates #**, make and model of vehicle was a jeep Cherokee. This man refused to give us a ride because we were heading to Indio and told us he would only give us a ride if we were going to Los Angeles or Orange County. This is the worst customer service as we were ready to go home and he just straight out denied us a ride because he would not make the money he wanted by giving us a ride. You guys shouldn't hire people that don't care about customer service and just deny people a ride because they simply don't think it's worth it.\n",
      "Anti gay bully,  told me,  faggot fck ur self with mcd frappe u loser faggots should die. If uber ever sends him to better find a request another driver\n",

      "Me and the birthday girl my best friend and one of her friends went out to celebrate her birthday. The plan was we all pitch in for a ride there and back and since we all lived in the same direction we would just have the driver drop us off individually until he reach his destination. (Which we normally do with no problems) We dropped off the birthday girl 1st and then 5 blocks away it would be my turn, but this driver refuse to turn into my parking lot which left me no choice but to just have stop in the middle of the street to let me out. As I got out in a hurry I dropped my keys in his Van. I had my friend contact the third girl but she was too drunk to pick up.\n",
      "Driver never showed and had the audacity to charge me for the full ride. I paid for it, was left with no ride and super late for my event. I finally called a cab - yes a CAB which showed up, more than I can say for MARIO, Jersey City driver from hell. If you see Mario as your ride, cancel it asap. He charged me 100%, for a ride I never took. Never saw him, ever. Uber refused to credit my account,after 4 requests.. So here is how they do business: Charge you whatever they want, and never even have to pick you up or be accountable for leaving you stranded. I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN! By the way, how about common courtesy for a customer who was been a loyal passenger for years, this is how they treat people. BE warned, until you face it, you won't believe it. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE whatsover. I boycott Uber and will pass the word along as many times as I can\n",
      "This annoying uber company keeps charging my account for trips i didnt book. They charge a non existing trip when all my family members were at home over the weekend. when nobody went anywhere, they came up with a trip charge. It was very annoying there is nobody to complain to. I was charged for a trip when I wasn't in the country for heaven sake. Many charges on my account to Uber company are pretty questionable. Once your bank details are loaded, you can't delete, this means they have access to your money anytime. Uber is a fraudulent company, I will continue to seek for justice until I see it.\n",
      "An Uber driver named Andrew driving a Ford Fiesta ** verbally assaulted my daughter and her mother. He called them both several **. I heard the commotion and came out to see him circling the block for a second round of profanity. I found out later that he used physical contact trying to remove them from his vehicle at the wrong stop.\n",
      "I recently applied to drive for Uber. It's been weeks and I still haven't heard anything. I have a clean driving record except a ticket I got a few years back because my license had expired because I moved addresses and never got the letter to renew and due to my busy schedule I never even thought to change my license at the time because of the move.\n",
      "This \"company\" never responds to Emails or complaints... even wrote to the CEO (travis@uber.com) and no response. The app sends error messages with a link that goes to a page that says \"Sorry, we couldnt find that page\". Unfortunately Lyft does not operate in Kansas City, Missouri... so we are SOL.\n",
      "Uber should review how to serve his customers. To delete my Uber account, it takes me 2 days and more than 10 messages-conversation with Uber Help Staffs (please review the history of messages)! It make customers like me scare and bore Uber! Let customers delete their own account as easy as creating an account! They also have no official notice by email to me about deleting my account and credit card informations.\n",
      "I have to have my vehicle inspected, no problem there. There was an option that I could do it via video chat, so I did. Through the Uber inspection page/site. Well they have no clue what I am talking about and that I have to upload documents that I was not given. I was told via video chat that Uber would get the inspection right away, 2 weeks later and still they do not have anything. I have tried to get a hold a person to verbally talk with and nothing. Just emailing and then there are more than one person trying to help and then it get aggravating. I think they have the worst service as far as helping the drivers. I am about to no longer drive for them because this is just getting out of hand. If you want to have great drivers give them better service when it comes to helping them.\n",
      "I waited for almost 1 hour, every time I looked the app kept giving different time updates so I waited since it was rush hour after all in Atlanta.  After 1 hour I contacted the driver and he claimed to not have any record of my request and that he had already picked someone else.  He kept putting me on hold and told me to take up with Uber.  I will NOT use this company again, the app has been removed from my phone!\n",
      "Driver never picked me up and I was charged a cancellation fee. He never arrived. I was waiting outside. He never found my home address. I contacted Uber and this was their reply: \"Thank you for getting in touch. We've reviewed this POOL trip and can confirm that you were charged a cancellation fee appropriately.\"\n",
      "Let's be honest, who would mind paying couple $$ for a ride and relax in the back set listening to music and not dealing with traffic, especially here in LA. But Uber won't let you enjoy this convenience as much especially recently when they changed some of their policies. Here is an example, it is late at night, you just had fun in your friend's house and it is time to request Uber to take you home. You request Uber. Wait outside for the driver. In this phase, ETA become slow. 8 minutes waiting.\n",
      "I have been using Uber for many years (especially as a consultant, I used them weekly for my work travel to/from airports) but was disgusted with the way the company treated me as a customer. On 4/13, I requested a pickup from LGA, Terminal C, Pickup area 1. I attempted to call the driver 5 times to let him know my exact location at Terminal C pickup area but got his voicemail each time. I waited over 15 mins just to see him drive past the requested pickup area and continue to drive through all of Terminal C (as I was trying to chase him down) without slowing down or attempting to pull into any of the subsequent pickup areas to look for me. \n",
      "I referred a friend to Uber and got a free ride. I made a ride and my free ride didn't work. When I asked Uber to reimburse me they said they'd block my account for some violation they couldn't explain. I asked questions and tried to clarify the case, and they sent me 5 (!!!) absolutely similar emails with NO answer to any of my questions. So this is how Uber support works and this is what you get for referring friends.\n",
      "They charging unfair money for the trips! I had 3 miles trip which is about 15 minutes and they charged me Ã‚Â£15.41 pounds! When they showing how much would cost your trip on the app, it was from Ã‚Â£5 to Ã‚Â£7 pounds, but they charged Ã‚Â£15.41!!! Liars and thieves!!!\n",
      "App was showing me cab is 5 minutes away. By the time I come down from my building and reach my society gate. The cab was there but drive didn't allow me to seat. He said I have cancelled ur ride. He didn't even call me before canceling it. It was quite rude. Never expected such kind of experience with uber.\n",
      "I am using uber for more than a year _x000D_Never got disappointed... _x000D_Now uber is offering me 25% off, 75% off that is totally fek ! I never got discounts.... _x000D_I have used lots of coupons by inviting my frds with my promo code_x000D_But now  ! While I enter my promo code. Uber says invalid ... Though I can book a cab but not getting promotion benefits and the fek summer offers ..\n",
      "Be alert for selecting UberPool for a reduced fare but being charged UberX or Economy at double the fare. When attempting to resolve, the company will state things such as 'we've adjusted a fare in the past for you' coupled with 'your fare is correct,' finally with a conclusion of 'your driver selected the trip in good faith.' I have been an Uber passenger on many occasions and never had a fare adjusted. My fare was absolutely incorrect and my driver selecting my trip is great, however, I wish to not pay a much higher fare for a type of ride I did not select. Uber leaves their customers with no additional help or recourse but to dispute charges with their credit card company.\n",
      "I took an UberGo taxi today morning from my home (Tambaram) to my office MRC Nagar. I saw the payment estimate to be around 304-350 but I was charged 484. Added today is my first Uber ride. I also struggled with making payment via my card. I dont have payment wallet option so I have previously added my card details to the payment option. But the payment gateway through my card was not enabled. Need proper explanations from authorities.\n",
      "On 4-17-17 I signed up as a new to Uber customer. I tried to schedule a ride for the following day, but not knowing how Uber worked I inadvertently requested an Uber driver for the wrong day. When the driver profile popped up I called him and told him that I had inadvertently order the Uber ride for the wrong day, he said (the driver's name was Javier) he would cancel the ride for me. I trusted that the ride was cancelled, but to my surprise another driver was on his way to my home (David), I immediately cancelled this driver and suddenly was confronted with a popup saying I was being charged a cancellation fee of $5.00. I never ordered a second driver, so I do not know how another driver could be sent.\n",

      "I book hotel to airport. I booked for 48sar and finally it costs 84sar when I received the email. This is more expensive than a normal cab. This is more expensive than the official cab which I took when I did the single trip from airport to hotel. Uber, you messed up, you start to be like Ryan Air!\n",
      "Uber driver and the people that work in the office is very unprofessional. They do not pick you up in front to your door, the drivers are always canceling and you're stuck with the driver's cancellation fee which is unfair. The only communication you have to complain is thru email which is stupid. It should be a phone number for you to dial and speak to someone.\n",
      "Concept of Uber is great. Try finding customer service is the pits. Once you contact them via messaging you will find that if you have an ongoing conversation, replies their system is set up to tag next available service rep. Meaning every time you send in your reply, a new service rep has to review all the conversations to get the rest of the customer's problem. Extremely time consuming on both parts. My wife is presently texting them as I write. I'm not a patient man and have spent two three days going back and forth on a relatively simple question. \"How do I add my payment method to my account\". Simple right? What a BS management team they have. It usually lies on management too.\n",
      "On the evening of March 25, 2017, I scheduled an early morning ride with Uber for March 26 to Dulles airport. A few minutes after our requested pickup, the driver called and said he was on his way. We noticed on the Uber app that his vehicle was at Dulles and was not moving towards our location. The driver subsequently called and cancelled the pickup. Since we did not have sufficient time to make alternate arrangements, we drove our own vehicle to the airport and paid $272 for two weeks of parking. We noticed that the Uber vehicle remained in the same position in the Dulles area while we were in route to the airport. Up to this experience, we have been pleased with the Uber service, however, we will not rely on Uber again when we need to be somewhere at a certain time.\n",
      "I'm not sure anything is in place to go after this deceptive \"company\". I can't even call this a company. It's nothing, it's an app. The charging practices have to be illegal. They come up with their own rules and prey on anyone using this \"app\". I see them losing out on their \"app\" and lawsuits will start piling up. Everyone thought the concept was good, I'm seeing the loopholes and Uber needs to go.\n",

My Suburban car is new 2016, I work hard for to pay and Uber told me they will reimburse me if I send the estimation not later than 5 days.

I can't wait to get customer service for drivers in USA!!! Drivers be aware please.\n",
      "I did one trip last month with Uber. But still I didn't get paid for it. I contacted with them. They all are liar. The day I did the trip same day I e-mail to them. They said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã…Â“you will see in your partner dashboard.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã‚Â But didn't show up. Then I e-mail again. They said 48 hours. After 48 hours I e-mail again. Now they are asking for information again. I said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã…Â“how many times I've to give you information.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã‚Â Then they ask for trip no.

      "Visited Orlando Florida and used Uber twice to return from Universal Studio. The first day I was charged 15.88 and the second trip cost 9.34. When I questioned the first driver about the route we were taking he advised he missed his exit causing him to take the next exit which was completely out of the way. The second driver took the direct route with no problem. When I questioned Uber customer service they explained how algorithms work and found no fault with the fare. I received my receipt and noticed the total should have been 12.84. They did refund the $3 difference but refused to acknowledge the difference in price between the first and second driver even though it was entirely driver error. After researching this seem to be a somewhat common practice. Will use Lyft in the future.\n",
      "I used Uber regularly as well as UberEATS. I loved the convenience! Once... Today I had a meeting across town. When it was over I requested an Uber pool for the cheap price and I had two hours before my next appointment. I'm thinking, \"shouldn't take more than an hour\". I was WRONG! The driver that picked my ride drove past me a minimum of 3x. I saw this on the little gps the app provides. The driver eventually started heading to the OTHER side of town! I tried calling twice to make sure he wasn't lost but he forwarded me to his VM both times and never reached out to me. Eventually, he heads away from my location and the ETA becomes even longer. \n",
      "I recently had THREE Uber rides charged to my credit card, charges which my bank originally refused. When I complained to Uber via e-mail, I got a series of potted replies, with them eventually asserting that \"they believed the charges were legitimate.\" Only after having the charges reversed with my bank and contacting Uber a fifteenth time did I get the explanation that my credit card details must have been acquired OUTSIDE Uber and then linked to an Uber account. This is NOT a very convincing explanation. \n",
      "I have had an ongoing complaint with Uber and it has finally hit the boiling point. I have been taking Uber quite faithfully twice a day for several months now and my pick up and drop off locations have never changed however Uber consistently changes the one address every time. I was OK with that since I was still getting where I needed to be until they started changing the quoted fees as well. When I called them out on it they would say that they had checked and that the information they had was correct. I have emailed them copies of the address plaque on the building where they are picking me up and they are still insisting that I am being picked up at a different address and that it is a longer ride and therefore a higher fare. The address they are insisting is wrong. Is the address for the commuter train station! The really irritating part is that the place that they are insisting I am being picked up at is the building where they house the trains!!\n",
      "I am in Boston on business. Today, I send for Uber to pick me up after lunch at Roxy's Grilled Cheese. The first driver, accepts then 2 minutes later he cancels. The 2nd guy drives right past the restaurant. I text him to tell him he just passed by, then he cancels. The 3rd person, I text to tell her in advance that I am standing in front of Roxy's Grill. She calls and says she's there. I tell her she'e not because I'm standing outside the door (in the cold rain this whole time mind you). She says okay she'll be right there and cancels. I go back in the restaurant to tell the guy behind the counter what's going on. Recommends that I walk down to Walgreens and get Uber from there which I do after being very frustrated. Finally, someone by named Moses arrive. I tell him the story and he's very apologetic. I get back to my hotel and see that I have been charged $5 for each cancellation. I email Uber and informing them of what happened and they are refusing to credit my account. Welcome to Boston!\n",

      "We are going on vacation soon and it was suggested by our resort that uber would be less costly than a taxi. I set up an uber account. Because I did not want to store a card number that was attached to my account or use a credit card that has thousands of dollars available to use I purchased a my vanilla visa debit card.  I talked to my vanilla and ask them if this would be a card I could use with uber. They assured me of the cards available this card would be the one to use._x000D_I tried several times to set up the uber account using this card and they would not take it. Not only that but the customer service people totally suck at their job. Basically I was told to bad so sad - and at no time did anyone investigate if there was a reason why you can not use this type of card. they just said sometimes they just don't work use a credit card. This type of card is used by many to receive direct deposit of payroll instead of having a checking account. One would think that uber would do some investigation to find out why there is a problem. So if you want to try and protect yourself by using this type of card don't expect uber to try and help figure it out.  Worst service I've ever received. Given all the other bad things I've seen in the news lately about uber workers and the CEO this should not surprise me.\n",
      "I live in SF and I will NOT use Uber (and Lyft) anymore because of rude driver behavior. I have found too many of the drivers, from those companies, don't follow basic courtesy of at least pulling off the road for a pickup or drop off. And I mean with a curb space a mere 2 feet away. In fact I saw a driver pick up a passenger in the middle of an intersection (granted it was a 3 way intersection). He block the traffic as is so often the case. Both companies need to list to their customer that the driver will stop at the closest parking or off road location. And drivers need to pull OFF the roadway.\n",
      "I used Uber once in a while because 1. they are really expensive. Their app has got problem. 2. I can not contact the driver in any way and every time I try to contact them it directs me to Uber Help which I believe there is nobody there to help. 3. You can never call Uber and talk to somebody, it sounds like to be that the whole thing is software and machine controlled. 4. If you by any chance cancel your ride they will charge you... 5. They are screwing taxi drivers, which are after and better. 6. Where I live they only have UberX which is nonsense and it is more expensive than Uber. They are making tons of money with their stupid application and system therefore I am deleting the app.\n",

Okay create my pay pal. Again unable to use payment try different form of payment. What!!! Fix your $#*!!!!  I even bought a *****@kng gift card and couldn't use that piece of crap. O and by the by the way all this time had me so damn late because I had to now take the train which if you don't know not all trains on Nj transit stop at the same locations so which an urber 25 min tops with traffic turned into 2 hours and 17 minutes.  I had to get a cab which to the train from my place 20$ where the whole urber ride was 13$ then round trip ticket 16$ then another 16 more for cab from train to appt back to train. Did I mention when I got back to train from appt. Yep you guessed had to wait 51 minutes for train then over 25 min on the ride when back to Dover instead of paying for another cab I waited yep 35 more minutes for my girl to pick me up. Thanks Urber could have been dropped off at station in the morning right on time then wouldn't havre been late and after appt got picked up on time from station. But instead of using train was going to take urber because it was the same price.  So I say again when your working it's great but it always has some sort of issue and no one to call you suck!!!!! Get your broken ass together and fix your issues for the future customers because you will need them you just lost one today I give you 2 middle fingers up for your performance!!\n",
      "They deducted total 202 Rs. for very short distance share/pool ride while showed only 54 Rs. while booking the cab. They first deducted 148 Rs. from my Paytm account after the ride completed on 22nd March around 8:30 pm. Then while I complained to customer care, next day they told they adjusted the fare to 54 and rest 148 will be refunded back in 3 days, and again deducted 54 Rs. from Paytm on 23rd March in the morning 7:53 am (I did not take any ride). So total 202 (148+54) Rs. deduction happened. Now after 6 days while I inquired asking about my money they told it was longer route and refund not processed. While I did not take any longer route after asking again and again. Also they only saying money is adjusted and no update about refund. Such a cheat.\n",
      "Uber will lose the race to Ola eventually. The negative news they find themself surrounded in will soon bring it down. I did not give much to those negative news until I recently (28th March 2017) witnessed their lack of customer care. The Uber cab was requested to reach Ramaiah Hospital at 3.00 pm. He did, but he refused to pick up my aunt who was on wheelchair. She was released from hospital after full recovery but aged 91, we did not want her to walk. He zoomed away in style. What did that moron expect when a customer calls from a hospital. We called the reliable trustworthy Ola and reached home sound and safe. In the process Uber lost a potential base of at least 50 customers (all my relatives whom we shared this incident with and we decided to stay away from Uber).\n",
      "Called and Uber black car to get my husband and me to DFW airport. The estimate for the premium black car was $91.00 but we decided to go for it this one time. We went the 20 miles from downtown Dallas to DFW in about 40 minutes since it was 7:00 in the morning. When I got settled on our plane I checked my account to see that they had charged me $152.00!!! I have been going back and forth with them for a week now and all I get is \"The fare you were charged is within our estimate for a trip from your pickup location to destination. As a result, the fare was not adjusted.\" Even though I have told them it was NOT what they estimated, I continued to get the same reply 4 different times. I finally just cancelled my account. There was no other recourse except to now tell my story so someone else won't get ripped off like I was!  By the way, the taxi ride back during evening rush hour was $50.00!!!\n",
      "Had difficulty figuring out the app on my Phone and as a result had to cancel the trip as soon as I entered it, the address I had entered for home and the place I was going came up wrong. I did not notice this until I booked the ride. Soon as I realized the error I canceled the trip. I actually had this error several time and canceled my ride. I made several other errors in trying to schedule a future pickup time and had to cancel the ride again. \n",
      "A week ago I tried Uber (hotel near LAX). I was told a car would be there in 5 mins but then the driver called and cancelled. A second one did the same and I got a cancellation message. However, I was charged $5. I reported it but all I get was a \"credit.\" This has happened before - in NYC. Complained but all I got was a credit which I have never been able to use. In any other business this would be called scam. In future I will use a cab - at least I don't get charged when they are not there.\n",
      "I requested Uber 3/24/17. We were going uptown. I live 10.2 miles from downtown Nashville. My rate was quoted at between $15 and $17. We used Uber there and back. I checked my bank account the next day and to my surprise Uber had charged me $34.50 going to Nashville and $15 coming back. When I inquired about this I was basically given the runaround telling me that I put in a different address than where we went. Once I showed them the Google mileage and the receipt that I printed out from Uber showing that I put in the correct address, now they have changed it to \"It was a demanding night, so the fares went up.\" That is really funny because the girl who drove us said it was a slow night. Uber overcharged then tried to lie about it. I will never use Uber again.\n",
      "I have been using Uber for a couple of years now. I use UberPool at least once a week. I recently requested a ride home from babysitting and was pretty upset when I was charged more than what I agreed to and that they wouldn't honor the initial price. The price I was told was $5.83, but when I got home I saw that it was $11.12. The driver did miss the exit and add more time and distance, so I figured that once I explain this to customer service that they would refund me the difference as this was not my fault. I hope that the driver didn't do this intentionally. They did not, and are standing by what they charged me. I am pretty heated and I am going to start to use Lyft as much as possible even though it is a little more expensive. I am super disappointed with their customer service.\n",
      "I woke up one day to find that someone had ordered a ride using my account in Philadelphia while I was asleep in New York. Naturally, I changed my password and sent an email to Uber's support team so that they could look into the issue. They did not look into the issue whatsoever, would not issue a refund, and failed to provide me with a number to call so that I could speak with a representative. Apparently, if someone steals your information from their poorly protected site/app and uses your money to pay for a ride, all Uber cares about is that someone paid for the ride. This will not be the only place I file a complaint.\n",
      "I have had a UBER driver who lingers in front of my apartment window... sometimes with headlights on and shining into my apartment. He lurks out there all hours of day and night. I have called the police and contacted UBER... nothing was done!! UBER response \"We cannot address nonrider complaints.\" He drives a white Lexus in LA license **. Complain if you ever get this creepy driver!\n",
      "I received a ride that was 13 miles and took less than 30 minutes. My original estimated coast was $27 the initial charge was $25. _x000D_24 hours later, I received an email stating the driver adjusted destination and my fee was adjusted to $160. I disputed the charge stating the original destination was correct. I Provided screen shot of google maps and pick up and drop addresses. After multiple emails back and forth, still no luck of Uber correcting the, what I call a, \"fraudulent charge\".  Customer service is less than desirable to say the least.  I have been giving the runaround. I have asked for a contact number to speak with someone live but no such luck.  I am now forced to dispute the charge with my credit card company and will being filing a complaint with the better business bureau.  I understand mistakes happen but failure to correct mistakes is in enexcusable. Uber not only lost a routine customer today but also gained poor advertisement from a dissatisfied customer. I will warn friends and coworkers against using Uber. To many other options.\n",
      "Requested a pickup in Seattle at 4:25PM on March 23rd and the request was accepted with a 7 minute ETA. I placed the pin exactly where I was standing in a very visible spot on a sidewalk that was easy to access. Watched the driver drive all around me on the Uber app but never coming closer than 3 or 4 blocks. After 30 minutes of this a message popped apologizing for the inconvenience, but the DRIVER cancelled, which now made me late for my dinner reservation. Adding insult to injury, I also saw that they charged me a $5 cancellation fee. I immediately disputed this and after many exchanges where I explained what happened and also pointed out that the driver far exceeded 5 minutes past the 7 minute ETA which entitled ME to cancel per THEIR OWN POLICY, the most they would do is \"promise\" a $5 credit on a future ride.\n",
      "Last Monday 03-13 I called Uber for a ride from Pomona Ca. to Ontario Ca. Airport. I got a contact and it showed approx. $18 dollars. All of a sudden the page went blank. I called Uber again requesting Uber again and the charge came up as $38.00 and gave a name of the driver and he was less than 10 minutes away. So I am in the parking lot of the business with my luggage, when he drove in. I waved to let him know I was the one. I am sure he saw me he was within 50-75 ft. away. Without hesitation he did a hard 180 degrees and sped out of the parking lot and was gone, without a word. I was a bit aggravated, So I dialed up Uber again. To the same pickup and same delivery points.\n",
      "I have been an avid Uber rider for quite a while. But recently, they've been in the business of disabling rider accounts for NO APPARENT REASON. I'm stranded in the freezing rain trying to request an Uber, and my account is disabled and they won't tell me why. They keep telling me it's for SECURITY reasons. Well I pay all of my fares so there's no reason for my account to be disabled. Today was the last straw. I requested a ride to work, which of course needed to be in a timely manner. The driver was initially around 5 minutes away. But 5 turned in to 10 minutes, which turned into 15 minutes. \n",
      "I ordered an uber to get to work this morning and after 5 minutes of not moving, the driver called and said if I wanted a ride, I would need to go with him to LAX.  That obviously was not an option, so I canceled.  I should have insisted that the driver canceled, but lessons learned._x000D_Anyway, I was charged a cancellation fee and immediately complained.  Respond #1 fored back immediately from \"SC\" saying we charged you correctly.  I said no you didn't and asked for a refund.  Hazel L provided me a credit, which would have been fine if that was the initial response, but since I needed to go through hoops, I demanded a refund back to my credit card.  Gretchen C responded that is against policy._x000D_Mind you, I am a 400 dollar/month uber user (I used uber eats at work pretty often) so this absolutely blew my mind.  I can say that uber has officially lost a user forever, I hope the company implodes with the recent negative PR storm that has hit them._x000D_Congrats Lyft, eat24, and postmates, you have a new customer!\n",
      "I took uberPOOL and the rate came to 13.40 and used promo code for $5 discount. While alighting my driver said to pay 8.40. I paid cash and alighted. Again on 16.03.2017 I took and it showed 10.90 I confirmed pick up. While alighting driver asked 15.90. I said \"why\" he said I had $5 balance to pay to Uber. I didn't want to block the road and cause traffic jam so I settled. Strange! Do you even have credit facility for Uber trips. I didn't give my card details only cash payment. Then how they let me alight for less fare and charge it later. Discrepancy in fares and that too after 5 days charging. I wanted to refund the extra $5/ charged to me but Uber complaint firm asks for my card details when I am dealing in cash only. I would like Uber co to clarify why I was charged extra. Now my trip list also doesn't show those previous discrepancy.\n",

      "I took on a trust factor with Uber and I got ripped off and was left in cold and I suffered severe pain as well. The drivers are great but whoever is doing the money part they took too much. In return I had no way home. I kept telling them what they did. They kept showing me receipt when days before it was a lot lower.\n",
      "I have been a loyal customer of Uber. I cannot even get a hold of anyone. The drivers have been great. However their charging system is unprofessional and unreliable. I am going to have to report lost or stolen due to them. They do surcharges which flash so fast you don't even get a chance to see their charges. They also start charging you for rides that you do not even take or had even requested or even authorized. This is how they get your money and scam you. I wouldn't trust Uber unless it is a once in awhile type of thing, because when you are a continuous customer they drain your account and if you don't watch it closely you could be overdrawn with many fees. Luckily I watch mine. I am going to have to go to Lyft. Hopefully they are better.\n",
      "I have used Uber in Miami Beach, Rio de Janiero, and Costa Rica. It is fast and convenient to get a car to my location, and the fact that there is no guessing what the cost of the ride is going to be is simply excellent. What I really like the most is the fact that you know who your driver is going to be and what type of car he is driving.\n",
      "It would be of great help if uber came up with simple terms or explained what is a uber pool while booking a cab.i booked a cab and chose the option of uber pool since that was the first available option while booking a cab.and the picture of the car for this option was a small car while the other options and pictures were of fancy cars._x000D_When the cab arrived I realized it was sharing,initially I found it a little weird but I agreed to get into the car.the sharing drop was at prabhadevi.so I insisted the driver to drop me first since Wadala comes First.the driver agreed to drop me,but later said that the route on his phone was prabhadevi so he has to drop me 2nd.I told him I would like to get down and asked him how much did it cost.He said he will only be able to tell me once my trip ends.which i found ridiculously lame.Only if uber could come up with a better solution to cancel or discontinue the service.I had a bull$#*! experience will never travel uber in India atleast.WORST experience. 1)wasted 1.30mins of my time and will also recommend my family and friends not to take uber atleast in India.\n",
      "I requested a trip using UberPool. I have been using it daily to the same location. Today, when I received an Uber receipt, my daily charge of $2.99, was higher, $8.18. I used their app to dispute the charge, but receive a crazy response stating that I was charged correctly. They are liars and too lazy to even research the issues. Looking at the map on the app, the driver drove to my location, then continued on. No one else was in the car with me. He should have ended the call when I reached my location.\n",
      "Excellent app. Doesn't beg for tips. Lets you rate driver's ambiance. Shows proximity of driver to your location. Allows 2 way communication with driver en route. Many drivers have a visible Uber sign to identify the vehicle. Have been transported to and from the hospital with crutches sometimes a walker and each has been super helpful and courteous.\n",
      "I was having my 18 yr old son picked up and the driver was texting and driving and I told him not to, cancelled my ride and now my account is disabled.

So I have moved to Lyft!! Screw Uber!\n",

      "This morning I ordered a cab at 545 am on my app. My credit card was charged. The app said driver was 5 minutes away... It showed the car going further from my home. After 20 mins I called driver 2 times he did not pick up. I cancelled the car 5 mins later (total of 25 mins). I ordered a new cab on app that came in 5 mins... They charged me for ride and cancellation fee. I emailed them since there is no customer service number and they basically told me because I cancelled I'm being charged. They are crazy and basically called me a liar. Why would I order another cab if I was lying and they refuse to credit my card... So now I had to cancel my card. I will never ever, ever use their service again. They even put in my wrong address. They are crooks. Imagine how many people they get this way... It's disgusting.\n",
      "I used Uber to go to a stressful dr's appointment and wish I would have driven myself if I could have. The vehicle was a mess, it smelled awful and the leather seats were sticky. (I was afraid to ask why.) It was a bad trip anyway because the place I was going is very traffic busy. The driver swerved in and out of traffic, and at least 10 miles over the speed limit. And very rude.\n",
      "I lost my cell phone in an Uber vehicle on a vacation to Las Vegas.  Trying to track down the driver was a 12 day nightmare.  Uber's doesn't really have a customer service.  They have a few people available on twitter or a Uber lost item report that will eventually get a response.  First Uber does not have a lost item link of their website home page or App.  They also demand full rude detail, drivers name, date of trip, cost of trip, time of trip and pickup and drop off locations.  So if you lost your phone, and don't have access to their app or a computer your screwed.  I send various Uber contacts a minimum of 25 messages.  Only when I purchased another iPhone and another SIM card from my service provider could I go through the secure process to use my old phone number and get into the app to get the ride detail.  So I give them the detail that they could have looked up any time and they basically tell me that the driver has my phone and that I need to contact the driver through the app to get my phone back.  Then then scolded me for opening multiple threads containing the sMe issue and sId my case was closed.  I complained asking them how they could close my case when I do not have my phone back, they did not reply because they don't care.  I went through their \" contact the driver\" process 7 times over 4 days and no one ever answered.  Only on my 8th try did I reach the driver 12 days after it was lost in the car.  Uber is an arrogant, rude company that does not care about providing customer service.  The have no toll free numbers for customers and their online support is terrible.  They tell you that they have sent you several DM's.  I said I looked and could not find any Direct Messages from them.  That's because the messages are hidden in their app under a help link.  How are customers supposed to know that?  I now use Lyft and they are awesome and will never ever use Uber again.  I want to be very clear, the driver is not the problem, when I was finally able to reach him he was polite and very helpful.  This is all Uber's rude unfriendly business model\n",
      "Figure out how risky it is that UBER can charge right into your credit card whatever they want after the fact!!! One day on the same route, I was charged 3 times as much as with other driver, some UBER driver intentionally took a longer route to get to my destination to charge me more, I did not know until after the trip when I check my emails by end of the day, it was too late and it was very hard to find a right subject to submit a complaint with UBER. Their customer service is horrible: they don't listen to your complaint, they are just using patterns of reply. I WILL NOT USE UBER AGAIN as I think some Uber drivers have a way to rob customers.\n",

When I cancel a ride due to low review scoring by other passengers, they have charged me cancellation fees and refused to refund me the $2.  This happened three times in a row where I cancelled those trips within less than 24 hours.  Lyft allows me to cancel trips if I do not like the driver's review score and has now configured me to ride with drivers with a 4.6 score or above.

The cab driver on the way there got off the freeway on the wrong street and had to turn around, he charged me for his mistake, and the other cab driver he charged me cancellation fee.

Well unfortunately by the time we got there I was already past my appointment time seven minutes or so so they would not honor my appointment. They told me I had to pay a rescheduling fee because I didn't cancel my appointment within 24 hours.

I told him to reverse more as my foot was still stuck. Passers-by had to yell at him before he decided to move back. The pain was unbearable.

The driver was a pleasant college student with a neat, clean car. We used Uber during the Olympics in Rio last summer and it was cheap, and the drivers were quick.\n",
      "Have been driving for uber for 3 weeks and they take almost half the fare and call it a booking fees and then another fare fee. They don't charge enough, they encourage people not to tip, they let passengers cancel and don't compensate for drivers time, they don't tell you the final destination until passenger is sitting in the car....I could go on and on. They use drivers to make millions but really could care less about them. Why can a passenger see picture of me but I can't see a picture of them?? So many issues that I'm shocked they are still in business.\n",
      "I've only used Uber and it's generally very good. But on 2 occasion (out of 10) either never showed or couldn't find my location which is very inconvenient. I had to find alternate method.\n",
      "My first experience with Uber was in San Diego. My wife and I had attended an event at the Union Station and wanted a ride back to our hotel. We called taxi, but the message was that they did not have any vehicles in the area, \"but we could call back in an hour to inquire again.\" We then downloaded the Uber app. and less than 5 minutes later an Uber was there.\n",
      "I live in Las Vegas, NV and had an experience with one of their drivers (tailgating me on the freeway w/ passenger in their car). I have sent them messages through their website and every other form of social media to just let them know they need to check their drivers more thoroughly and they are nitwits. I am getting canned responses and no one is acknowledging the issue at hand. Sounds like a real winning company, that's for sure.\n",
      "I have been using Uber for quite some time now normally through the app, but since I'm fighting with my phone company I have been ordering via internet at m.uber.com. I normally take the pool because it is cheaper obviously but m.uber.com doesn't provide fair quotes for the pool. I have to cross reference with UberX first to ensure no surging then make pool request. So I did that like normal and the price was 11-16, so I figured the pool should be at least less than 11. To my surprise I paid 15.52. I even took a screenshot and sent it over to Uber but no reply except the automated message. Straight rip off. Use Lyft.\n",
      "I used Uber last weekend for the first time and both my drivers were amazing. I felt very comfortable and safe. Found the experience very good.\n",
      "On a recent ride there were 5 of us jammed into a little Uber car with our suitcases and the ride cost me more than the taxi I took going to the airport. Watch out for extra charges, user fees. The company is very greedy. Just imagine how much the company made off the five of us per hour.\n",
      "Uber tempt you with a cheap fare when you request the ride only to find they charged you double to the same destination and no tolls. Also the driver cancelled the job and they still charged me. When I complained they said they refunded me but it's not true and never received any refund\n",
      "I've had more than one experience where you request an Uber, they confirm pick up, then never show. Myself and my friend stood for a half hour at 10 pm at night waiting because the driver called and said they would be right there. It was dark, and we were 2 women standing there on the street feeling unsafe as we waited. Then for the next 2 days I had to deal with Uber charging my card for the cancellation. They wanted to satisfy me with a $5.00 credit for the whole inconvenience. Seriously... Very unreliable and not very worried about customer safety and satisfaction.\n",
      "Uber is one of the most shady unethical companies ever created. I stopped driving for them over a year ago, but decided to try UberEats as a delivery person. I figured it would be better because I wouldn't have to drive people - boy was I wrong. First, they take 35% of every delivery. Then they don't have enough delivery drivers so I noticed I was driving 15 to 20 mins to reach a restaurant (which you are not compensated for), to pick up an order that is being delivered to a location that may be 2 to 3 mins away. Giving the driver a whopping $2.86 for that delivery. I have also gone to pick up orders only to arrive at the restaurant, to find out the order was cancelled and Uber doesn't compensate the driver with a cancellation fee. The order still showed active in my app, but nobody took the time to notify me.\n",
      "Our 15 year old boys hailed an Uber ride late Friday night (February 24, 2017).  Well.....let's just say they aided in our boys running away from home.  Check out their rules, and it says you need to be 18 to call for a ride, or have parental permission!  Umm....not 18, and no permission!!!  Good job Uber!!!\n",
      "I want to start off by saying I will never use uber again ! First off every time I take a trip I know the rate is a certain price doesn't matter that I go home at a certain time of the day I know it has always been this price I been riding this specific route for some time but today took that same trip & literally price said the same thing & so the price is between 15 to 16 bucks & so literally get in the uber of course & literally was having problems with the app cause there always some problem with there app & got home to my place to look & see that I was charged 37 for my ride when I was charged wrong for like the 4th or 5th time before it has happened they reversed it now they could not reverse it so in short screwed me over & now they are talking about they said I went past my location when I didn't so now I'm letting everyone know do not use uber because they are disrespectful & will not reverse me for money\n",
      "They are not giving there service in Kanpur ...  #The 11th Biggest city...  Very very poor ....Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card ...I just Uber Cabs .....\n",
      "I arrived in Las Vegas 2/21/17, called Uber - driver Judylynn - acted very nice etc. asked if I wanted to charge my cell phone. Not thinking that it wasn't necessary I gave it to her to charge. She dropped me off at a Hotel on the strip. I soon realized I left my phone in her car. Gone! - You can't get in touch with Uber by phone. She won't return it. I am going to call the LVMPD and report it stolen. And get the security video. This is Horse Manure!!! - What the hell is wrong with people (some). You're fired!\n",
      "How do they keep getting away with things. I use Uber everyday multiple times a day. I've had drivers blow stop signs and drive recklessly etc. I needed an Uber the other night so I used my app and I was connected to Mohammed. He immediately calls me to tell me he is over 20 min. away even though my app which has always been accurate said he is 12 min. away. I told him I would wait. 30 min. later since he obviously took his sweet ** time he pulls up more than halfway up the block. I walk towards him and as I'm about to open the door on the driver's passenger side he drives off. He actually could've hit me and hurt me. I called him repeatedly with no answer. He then pulls up on the other end of the block on a main road. As I speed walk towards him waving my arms he drove off again. I then saw him drive by again and drive around the neighborhood and park around the block from me as you can see it on the app. I called him but nothing. \n",
      "First, I want to say, I've used Ubers for a few months and NEVER had a problem. Wanted to write what happened and let others know Uber is great! A friend always used Uber in Phila. I had no idea what it was. I recently moved to Florida - took a trip back home to Phila. via Tampa airport. The cost for an Uber to airport was $27 and I gave a tip. On my way back from the Tampa airport, I would also use an UBER. WRONG! Again, NO IDEA that Ubers were not allowed near the Airport. After my flight got in LATE evening, I got online to summon an Uber... the site would not pull up. I tried again and again to no avail.\n",
      "I had the experience of being stolen from by an Uber customer, despite contacting Uber, using the police as legally expectations, Uber has declined to give the police the information they need to prosecute their thieving customer. It's sad that Uber came into the Kenyan market and is above the Kenya police. They have made it impossible to get reprieve on crimes committed by their drivers, and customers. To get to their security team is an email nightmare. They have no phone communication and have a confused staff who keep sending junk mail despite the complaints.\n",
      "I was charged for a trip I didn't take the person took the uber from Bridgeport to Trumbull their system of complaining is awful I keep saying the I  did not take the trip was charged wrongful the thing respond back check if your family use your app or whatever I have no family here the driver took a wrong person ._x000D_We need a human being in their customers service or u guys do because I deleted that thing I was so pissed I don't have kids yet to be responsible of someone yes it was 13 dollars some changes that's lunch and dinner to me ._x000D_It awful.\n",
      "Be careful as Uber is getting sloppy with overcharges, not providing credits, and charging Cancellation fees when it was not me who canceled. This All happened within the last week. Uber was late in arrival twice in the last week. They sent me a text message each time stating they would credit the next fare. It was only $1.99 for each ride. I never keep the text messages as I don't remember having this sort of problem. I ride quite a bit so I didn't think anything of the credits until the a couple days after the 2nd ride.\n",
      "We all know Uber is lousy (try Lyft instead), but here's another example: Arriving at the Fort Lauderdale airport, tried to do an Uber. It was accepted by the driver, then they called and cancelled saying it was too early for them. They told me to go to the app and cancel it myself (I assume so they could charge me and not get in trouble for cancelling a ride). This happened a second time with a different driver exactly the same. Then finally the 3rd one arrived. Uber didn't charge my credit card for the 2 cancelled fees, instead they charged it for the entire amount of the 2 rides I didn't take and they list it on their site as a cancelled, so if I wasn't paying close attention to my credit card transactions, it would have gone unnoticed. \n",
      "We had a flight at SFO and uber never arrived at the time we ask to be picked up. They sent me three different messages they said that they would be 15 minutes then 35 minutes then 45 minutes. We cansal and drove ourselves and miss our flight. I sent  sent my complain and they said that the driver was on time. I don't know why they could not see the message that the driver sent  and at what time I needed to be picked up. Never gain I will use there service. I will never recommend them.\n",
      "I saw the commercials and needed transportation as I am disabled and my knees and legs are also weakened. I opened a Uber account, added a promo code, and thought I was set for my first trip, wrong! I was refused pick up 5 times and was stranded. I tried walking but my legs gave way and fell on the side of the road, a stranger helped me and gave me a ride home. I contacted the company and they stated the account problem is fine on next ride. I was dropped off by a family member before his work, then called Uber again, and again I was refused a ride so I had to pay 25.00 out of pocket as I had my granddaughter which had to be dropped off home then myself.\n",
      "I purchased a flat fare package in NYC and could use it in all 5 boroughs for $2.99 Uber pool or $5.99 Uberx the fare has to be below $30. I take an Uber pool that clearly quoted $2.99(I have a screenshot) and was charged $41.00. I contacted Uber customer service which sucks and was told the driver had an issue which prevented this trip from being timed according to proper pick up and drop off. It clearly states $2.99 and they felt \"the driver had to be compensated\". This company is putting out fake advertisements and charging a totally different fee without the customer's consent.\n",
      "Here is what I sent. \"I am sick of your fraudulent charging cancellation fees. When I cancel within SECONDS of ordering a car, a pop-up warns that there \"may\" be a fee for canceling more than 5 MINUTES After ordering. Yet you regularly charge a cancellation fee. I have asked your customer service people to escalate to your Legal department. This is an illegal practice. Then I have to dispute the charges. You are gambling that most people won't complain or won't notice. I notice. Today I canceled two cars within seconds of ordering because the eta was too long. I got charged and your customer service is refusing to refund me this ILLEGAL charge. Disgusting. I will inform every legal authority I can think of in order to protect the public. Meanwhile I demand a refund for my two appropriate (per YOUR rules) cancellations.\"\n",
      "Last nite i got a ride to the hospital.I have a bad leg,i can see hospital from my house.So i thought i would try uber this was my thrid ride i get a cab all the time he picker me up at my house.I guess he was in a bad mood that happens i understand that when we got there he charged me 7.00 my cab costs me 4.00 dollars i was robbed and when i went i was pissed i have been there 20 years and i told myy people you just lost a ton of buss every one was going to try it but not now and how do you know if my ride was 1 that got recorder for my free rides in the future.

      "We booked & confirmed pickup in Anna Maria Fl to PIE 4 am Fri the 10th. No show. Lost our flight so had to get another from Tampa to Omaha which cost 4 of us 2200.00. Did talk to someone at Uber & they said nothing they can or will do. Shouldn't they have insurance for something like this. Never again & not done with this yet.\n",
      "Supposedly Uber is meant to be cashless per their response below, unless you got my driver \"**\", The ride from Boca TOOJAY's Deli on Glades Rd to WPB started with a stop at a gas station where the driver complained the cost to pay cash vs credit card was $.25 more per gallon... The ride then went well until we arrived in WPB where the drive said \"I\" do not that credit cards when I offered him my card. This was fine, as I always carry cash. I asked how much, he said like, like $42 to which I said fine. I handed the driver $60 and asked for $10 back. He said he did not have a $10 and offered me a few ones....\n",
      "My Uber ride from my home to Wal-Mart was enjoyable. I paid $7.80. After shopping, I turned on the Uber app to request a ride. Everything was normal until the moment I pressed \"request ride\". The app moved to view the airport and asked me to select my location. I backed out and tried again, and the app still insisted that I select a location within the airport. Funny thing... There was a blue dot on my REAL PICK up location, but the app was not allowing me to click on the blue dot. When I manually entered my location, it still swung back to the airport!!! I had my 2 yr old with me and had no choice to agree to the ridiculous overcharging. When I brought this to Uber's attention, I was dismissed and they gave me a response of \"It was higher because of the demand for the Uber service\"... Yeah... OK!!! Long story, I was ripped off and Uber gives no **. I am NOT using this service ever again.\n",
      "I have been driving only two months but done with uber.  I noticed how unfair the prices, pay is so I decided to ask passangers to send me via text how much they actually paid (after they got the email with how much their actual fare was) and time and time again what I got paid based on fare was off by $1-4 on each trip!  They steal from the drivers!  Not only they take their 20% they take more!  When you report it on each trip they come back and say oh ok the fare will be adjusted, not only they adjust it wrong but you never see that money, ever.  When will that adjustment hit your account?  Never!  Be aware, you will pay more then 20% take, it's more like 35% most rides because if like the passanger pays $10 in reality they paid like 13-14$!\n",
      "Undisclosed charges and fees - This company does not offer support to its driver partners. They adjust fare payments without giving the driver notice and close http links to access driver support and withhold account information. I haven't received full payment for service rendered and can not reach a live person or received a chat response to resolve it.\n",
      "Two days ago I took a trip with Uber in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I normally use this service every day. Another passenger with me on the trip forgot their phone in the car. Since then we have sent about 20 messages to Uber Customer service. They finally determined that the driver found the phone but we are still waiting for it to be returned. Uber and the driver now have my direct contact information and yet the only way I can get any feedback is through the Uber Customer Service system. I think that in such cases Uber should make it easier for the driver and customer to communicate directly. I will no longer be using Uber or recommending their services after this incident. We just want our item returned and I no longer trust this service, its reliability or safety rating.\n",
      "Let me start by saying that I have a disability. My team in my office decide to have lunch at Clyde's in Chinatown. The driver taking me to me to Chinatown, did pick me up in front of our building but want I did not like about him is that he keep trying to invite himself to lunch. The return was a nightmare, I was watching the driver going around in circles. I tried calling him but he did not answer. He finally called me, I could barely understand him. He wanted me to meet him almost a block away. I told him I have and disability and needed him to pick me up in front of Clyde's, he then just cancelled my ride.\n",
      "Just wrote about the \"high\" driver going to downtown Nashville.  Wanted also to mention the ride back to hotel.  The 2nd driver was a young man looked to be around early 20's.  The car was very old and although it seemed cleaned out, it smelled horrible.  The thick stench of cigarettes literally made me sick.  We tried to converse with him and he hardly said two words. He really gave me a \"creepy\" feeling... like we were in a car with someone with \"serious mental issues\" (only nice way to put it) .   I think I'd feel safer in a regular Taxi any day.   I have to say though that I had a really good experience with two drivers I used in Destin, FL.  But the two I got in Nashville made me not want to chance Uber ever again.\n",

      "Uber is a horrible partner . Dropped its price again for the third time in less than two years and now I'm driving for chump change they want 5 star service for 1 star pay and the math just not working out . Furthermore they have partnered with local dealerships whereas they are taking advantage of people's economic situations leasing cars for outrageous amounts before nobody with bad credit could get approved now that Uber is on the scene miraculously any Uber driver can get approved which begs me to wonder just how sleezy the banks and dealerships are . Uber is a viper taking advantage of a certain demographic low income not educated driver trying to feed there families people say \" Nobody is forcing you .\" and to that I say \" And nobody is forcing me to feed my kids either .\" _x000D_Don't drive for Uber they are $#*!s period !\n",
      "My first ride in an Uber ride with my coworker. Our driver Jeffrey (LM28868) was very professional. He opened our doors for us. Vehicle was fresh and clean. We called Uber to take us to our cars that are parked at Cornwell Heights Station because the Regional Trenton Line was cancelled due to a fire. Very enjoyable ride. I was very impressed. Also had bottles of water, mints, gum for refreshments. Even music was too our taste. I will definitely be calling Uber again.\n",

I did it for a year and its not getting any better the price was reduced and the search pricing is a scam goodbye over\n",
      "A request for a UBER driver roughly on Feb 6th 2016 to pick me up at Wal-mart. According to the driver it would take her about 10 minutes to arrive at my location. When she didn't show, I called her for her ETA. She asked if I was in LA Mirada which was about 20 minutes away. I was in Stanton. Then she said that she had another pickup and had to cancel mine. On Feb 8 UBER took out $5.00 from my checking account saying it was for a no show... For a no show? How can it be a no show when the driver never showed. I called UBER and told them about it and they reimbursed the $5.00 but then on the same day took out the $5.00 again. \n",
      "I missed an important meeting at work because I had to walk a few miles in the middle of nowhere. This is because Uber would not work. They were updating the icon on the smartphone, which took an hour. I could not use the app while they were updating this icon. Absolutely absurd. They are losing customers because of silly updates like that. At least I have a pretty icon I can look at on my phone. They won't get my business again. It's back to calling taxis.\n",
      "I have used Uber about 6 times.  I have never had a problem.  Their response times are excellent and they help with my walker.  It would be nice if these reviews gave their general market location.  I am 65 and use a walker!!!!\n",
      "This is the 3rd time uber drivers have cancelled my journey and then when I reorder price has  mysteriously gone up 3x._x000D_It is  a joke and it ends up cheaper using a normal minicab, £28 instead of £60.\n",

      "I took Uber from Jacksonville Beach, FL to Jacksonville airport. The normal fare was $23.53 but Uber added surge fare of $54.12 for a total fare of $77.67. Additional surge fare was ridiculous. I'll not call Uber again.\n",

      "Sunday January 31st, I requested Uber with 2 friends to go home. It was surge pricing 4.3x, which was fine, considering my drop off location (my apartment) was only 7 miles away. The driver arrives, picks us up, then we drive home, get dropped off. Everything is fine up until this point. Next day I checked my phone, never got any type of email receipt (usually I get them immediately after I get dropped off) so I begin to think they didn't charge me. \n",
      "Uber, think twice. January I was flew out of Orlando to London. I called Uber. I live approximately 8 miles from airport. Going they charged me $13.00, week later to pick me up at MCO to go home charged my AMX $61.00. Tried to call, email, good luck.\n",
      "I downloaded the app and tried out a promotion to give me $22 dollars off our first ride, since it was our first time in Miami, we decided to use it. After waiting almost 45 minutes the driver said she picked us up and dropped us off in 5 seconds. Not only did she waste my time but my promo code. My fiance and I decided to give them a try again, this time he said he wanted to do everything. So he created an account and used the same promo code. The app stated it took it, after the ride was over, it sent us a bill and said if there is a problem contact customer service. It was only $14, but when we contacted customer service, Rachelle basically said we didn't put in a promo code so she refused to help us. Not only are the drivers terrible but the customer service is even worse. STAY AWAY from Uber. I tried Lyft after a friend recommended it, and honestly it's 1000x better! Good honestly people!\n",
      "My kids and I took Uberx to the airport to return home from vacation. My son realized he left his laptop at the hotel, asked the driver to go back. The kids and I go in to retrieve the laptop, gone maybe three mins, the driver did wait. I made sure he would be paid for the extra time. Anyway, about 15 mins into the trip. I get an unknown call from someone with an middle eastern accent named Mike ** claiming my email was hacked and wanted me to get on a laptop or desktop to \"solve\" the issue by getting IP addresses off my account. Told him couldn't, wasn't home. Checked email, no suspicious activity or threats showing. Changed my password and upgraded my security. Contacted Uber by email.

      "My credit card was charged over $170 on Uber rides I never took. I emailed Uber to complain about the fraudulent charges. They have yet to reply.

The Uber car never showed, neither did the cabs I called to pick me up from a retirement community in West Palm Beach two days after my father died. I missed my flight and now I'm worried Uber will charge my card or use it illegally since the app requires you to input your payment information into their system before the car pickup is authorized. At least the cabs I called don't have me locked into a financial trap. Definitely not a fan of a business taking my personal information without providing me a service. I selected a 1 for rating only because this site requires a rating but Uber gets a Zero from me.\n",

Government is actually making it easier for public to easily access drugs. _x000D_Taxi drivers are more reliable because they go through proper training! Taxi drivers have commercial insurance and their cars are inspected by county officers  whereas uber doesn't even have enough customer service representatives. _x000D_What would government do if one of these uber drivers rape or kill somebody or kidnap one of their clients for ransom and who knows if it's the same driver and these drivers don't even have to go through any kind of training. _x000D_This uber put lot of taxi drivers out of work! i don't think it's fair because this uber service is just extra money for some greedy people. Taxi drivers were working hard to raise their families so i think government should think about those families and ban uber and lyft forever so people can feel more safe!\n",

      "I had 12 fraudulent charges by Uber against my American Express account, including two that used membership rewards points. Total was more than $2,500. There were no other fraudulent charges on the card and AE removed the charges and restored the rewards points. As I understand it, there's no way this could have been done by Uber drivers. I expect it is the result of hacking of user accounts in the United States. I was also surprised that AE, which occasionally requires verification of legitimate charges to department stores because of suspected fraud, didn't prevent individual charges of over $900 to go through Uber.\n",
      "While I understand all of the cab-hating, the one point I worry about is insurance with Uber et al. This article talks about major injuries people experienced. Do these new startups have the same level of insurance coverage as traditional cabs are required to have? What will happen when the news starts reporting catastrophic injuries passengers receive in an Uber subscribed vehicle, but having to be on Medicaid because there was no insurance in place?\n",
      "More than once I've had to witness UBER drivers not following the laws of the road. For instance - one driver was driving on top of bicycle lanes and areas not meant for moving cars; another time, another driver was on a side street at a stop sign but made an inappropriate gesture with his hand and halted traffic moving along a busy road so that he could cross over despite not having the right of way.  It's not just infuriating, it is beyond unsafe to have these untrained, unregulated, unruly drivers be allowed to engage in such a profession and endanger the lives of others. They might have provided faster service, and maybe this is what they think will give them better ratings and reviews, but I would rather be alive and it is beyond shameful that UBER does nothing to discourage and prevent this sort of recklessness.\n",

The thing is, she and her friend never expected it to cost so much, and like so many other peopIe are stuck, desperate and are open to being gouged and taken advantage of. I have used uber as well for over a year and a half. My boyfriend also registered to become a driver but decided not to follow through. I am sad to say I disagree with your surge policy. I can understand a \"surcharge\"--even doubling the fare but this was unreasonable. _x000D_Needless to say, I will no longer continue to use your service and will in the future advise all of my clients (I own a hair salon and spa) not to use uber.

At 3am i ordered another uber to go back to our initial destination in which we took the same route, same distance, same everything and it was $86.!!!! On top of that, it was my first ever uber ride under my name and card so I SHOULD have received a first time uber user free ride, but the app never gave me one... So obviously I googled a different promo code that gave me $15 discount. So my uber fare would have been $100! I might as well have taken a taxi or risked driving my own car for 3x cheaper than uber. I thought uber was supposed to be a cheaper, easier, efficient alternative to getting a taxi or even renting a car? I will say my experience was polar opposite. I'm never using uber under my name ever again. My driver was nice though, a nice car too. But he took 15 minutes longer than my first driver and he barely spoke English. He also took 10 minutes longer than the ETA to get to us._x000D_So here I am emailing uber back and forth asking them to honor their first time user free ride. $86 is NOT WORTH IT.\n",

Okay so this Friday I went to an event in downtown and I decided to take uber home because I was tired thinking this would be a good idea.  First driver passes by me I am waving and he cancels I get charged $10. I should of just taken the bus but I order a second one, he sees me right away and he drives. Well I wasn't drunk just super buzzed.. I notice this guy is taking a diffrent route like way off and he got off far from where my address was and was driving so slow but I don't say anything. Until the next day when I see my receipt not only did my heart stopped seeing how much I got charged 194 dollars plus the ten from the other driver, I was soo angry and the time on the receipt said 2:00 to 5:00 am so this guy didn't turn off his uber, he probably thought she's drunk she won't notice..well I was trying to fight for this because what this guy is a scam like I get it we all need money but too step this low to get money is not correct. Soo after a few messages with uber there only going to give me $100 back but I am still going getting charged $86 like wtf that's still too much and after being super angry and what that driver did I don't want too pay anything..I don't think I'll be using uber anymore shady money hungry people.\n",

If I had not been driving for Uber and using Uber personally for more than a year I may have fell for your BS reviews and stories myself. I'm not saying all of these reviews are bogus, but I would say that 70 to 80 percent of these reviews are. Geez...who complains about rates that they agree to before hand?

The day before I took the same trip in a cab and it cost me $23.50 plus tip. After hours of trying to find a person at Uber I finally got through and he said that was their rate and blew me off.

Bare in mind this is on New Years Eve, a 23 year old girl alone, with no coat, visiting her sick mother in hospital. I cancelled it on the app as he advised as I could not be bothered arguing, and it charged me £4 for cancellation even though I did not want to cancel it, he said I had to!

Lately, I requested an Uber and the driver yelled at me over the phone for not being able to locate where exactly he is parked in a very big intersection and then refused to give me a ride after I already got in the car.

I had no idea that Uber drivers used their own personal vehicles to transport their customers. When the Über driver showed up he was on time. However his car was another story. It was an old well worn Ford Fusion that reeked from those cheap car interior deodorizers. The car was running poorly and was making a terrible whine at freeway speeds. I was gritting my teeth the entire ten mile ride wondering if this old clunker was going to detonate at any second. Also, I didn't appreciate having to listen to a forty minutes of reggae music thumping away either. In the past I have used Yellow Cab which has always been a favorable experience.

So, I took my first ride from downtown to Pittsburgh Int'l Airport.  The fare was $49!!!!  It was on a Monday at about 1:00.  Instead of the promised $25, I was only give $5.  I ordered an UberX and what came was UberXL.  My fare was twice the amount my husband paid a few days earlier.  Yellow cab would have been $40 and the super shuttle would have been $25.

He said OK and mumbled some words. As I began walking towards him he drove away. I see him loop around so I text that I'm at Southern Tire. He then sends an alert and cancels the trip. I enjoy using Uber but today's ordeal was very unpleasant. I'm awaiting Uber's response which I hear they rarely do.\n",

However, I didn't know this. I asked my driver if I could pay in cash and to not charge my card, and he said yes. So I paid him in cash and the next day I go on my checking account and see I was charged. The driver I had basically scammed me - lied about not charging my card and the price of the ride.

Anything lower than a 4 from a client get ready for a meeting with Uber, so just remember if you are in a bad mood don't give driver a low rating for your mood swing they will loose their jobs._x000D_So all around Uber wins, and rider or driver being the foot fodder for Uber.

We contacted Uber (which wasn't easy, there's hardly any working phone numbers) asking for them to message the other riders and find out if they accidentally took the bag. Even armed with a police report, Uber has done nothing to help resolve the matter. Clearly, riders should always remove their belongings and hopefully drivers will check the backseat to make sure it is empty. Sadly, this didn't happen and our son's personal belongings are in the hands of criminals with Uber's blessing.\n",
      "When I put in a request for an Uber driver, one driver responded and called me and said he is not allowed to pick me up at the Westchester county airport and drop me off in Westchester.  He directed me to put in a destination outside of Westchester.  I did not do this as I felt it was a scam and I would be charged a higher amount because the amount of the fare would be calculated based on a further destination.  When I declined his direction I requested an Uber driver again and a different driver told me to do the same as the first.  I declined again feeling it was a scam and took a regular taxi at that point.  Scamming passengers is a horrible way to do business.\n",

These were colleagues that were also going to the cruise port so I told them that I would take care of the fare. Once we got there, they gave the driver a very generous tip not realizing the tip was include, but the driver had no problem accepting it.

Early this week I called for a car, supposed to be a 5 minute wait turned into 20 minutes. I texted and called the driver multiple times but no response. Then he cancelled the ride without my consent, and had the nerve to charge me a $10 fee! Why should I pay for no service, especially the driver was the one who cancelled, not me! He was a no-show and I ended up walking few blocks to catch a cab and late for a meeting, after wasted close to half an hour waiting! The worse thing is, there isn't a customer service number to call. I emailed Uber support and they took a while to respond. I was offer a ride credit but I demanded a refund, as I had no intention to use them again. I filed disputes with both PayPal and my credit card, then all of a sudden Uber freezed my account. They have multiple agents contacting me and asked for photo ID and credit card copy...why would I do that? It's fraud waiting to happen, and can't be legal! I have sick of the way to treat their customers and how they conduct business. I am going to file a complaint with the BBB also, I will not use them again.\n",
      "Many people like me will have spent big money to buy a late model car and work with Uber._x000D_People will have borrowed money from their credit cards or  taken Personal loans or bought a car on finance to have a reasonable car to work with Uber. But in many cases with a single complain or bad rating they will put  the driver off the system. some of these complains could be invalid/unfair or just that  a rider is  in bad mood. I have faced one such incident where I have avoided taking a right turn on a no right turn sign and the rider has made a big story about it and I have been taken offline without being given a chance of telling my side of the story.  I will be getting legal advice and if there were no legal hurdles, I will be setting  a protest camp outside Sydney's Uber office and will be pursuing it further to highlight the Bullying behaviour of Uber. If anyone else want to join this protest please advise me via SMS on 61-469 627 875._x000D_Regards\n",

      "I need to warn all of you Uber drivers about Ubers $1,000 00 deductible through their insurance coverage.  I was on my way to pick up a passenger when I was hit by another vehicle.  Right away, I reported it to Uber in the San Francisco office.  A staff member insisted I contact my insurance company and report it to them.  I insisted this was not appropriate since I was on my way to a pick-up a Uber rider.  After much-to-do, I finally contacted my insurance company and they informed me I have no coverage at the time since I was picking up a Uber passenger. Afterwards, I went back to the Uber office  at which time the Uber rep. informed me that I had a $1,000.00 deductible through Uber's insurance. The upshot is that I was lucky the other ddriver had insurance.  Since it was urgent I get back on the road and I knew Uber's staff would not get me back on the road for several weeks, I decided to take the issue in hand myself and contacted the other driver's insurance company to get the repairs done.  _x000D_I hope Uber drivers are able to unionize in the Bay Area.  With a union backing Uber drivers, we won't be denied customer tips, and employee support for such things as insurance coverage with no deductible while on Uber time, better wages for the wear and tear on our cars, mileage reimbursment for travel time back to the original customer pick-up if we can't get a fare back to the original pick up or within 6 miles of origiinal pick up. _x000D_Regarding Uber's Customer Service to their drivers - service is below par. Also, please be aware, with no notification, Uber will shut you down as a driver if you report an accident to them until you obtain another vehicle inspection.\n",
      "I recently moved to Orlando and my car ended up the shop shortly after. I decided to try Uber to get back and forth to work. I really like the app and how you can see where the driver is so I know when to leave out my apartment and meet them. But prior to my order I added two credit cards to my Uber account. One is a bank debit card the other is a prepaid debit card, both with VISA logos. Uber defaulted to the bank card for payment. However, I wanted to use the prepaid debit card but for some reason it wouldn't switch. My bank card didn't have the funds for the trip but it allowed the pre-authorization.\n",
      "My wife after having cervical cancer had to have because of chemo and radiation to have her knee replaced in April of this year. As she was coming out of the doctors office on 25th Street and Park Avenue she had a hand up waiting for a cab and Google driver pulled up to her and after asking her where she was going (where she was going was the Port Authority), he weighed two handed her as to dismiss her and told her to take a yellow cab because it be cheaper and almost ran over her foot and driving away.\n",
      "I USE to drive for Uber but no more. Uber screws their drivers over...especially when they offer the guaranteed rates. You can never find out exactly how you're doing to see if you still qualify for the guarantee so you have to continue driving the entire 30-50 hrs to find out you did not qualify because of some stupid technicality....like 89.3% acceptance rate._x000D_They also screw over their customers. I had a rider get into my car by mistake so she still wanted to ride with me. When she cancelled her original request they charged her a $5 fee & when she put in another request while sitting in my car it gave her a different driver so she had to keep cancelling those drivers while being charged a cancellation fee until the uber app gave her my car as the right driver._x000D_Unlike Lyft, Uber does not pay too fees either.\n",
      "I will never be using Uber again, and I registered a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Uber charged my credit card for a cancellation when it is THEIR driver who cancelled, not me. I thought it was a good faith mistake, but what was their rectification? \"Future credits\". Appalling! They took MY MONEY, and now they want me to use their service to get MY MONEY back. My only regret is that I cannot do more than register my BBB complaint, plaster my situation on social media, and stop using their service. What they are doing is illegal. Yes, it was only $5.  But, they do not have a right to take $5 out of my pocket while not delivering any service to me. Again, THEIR DRIVER CANCELLED! Is this a new business model for them? Have their drivers cancel and charge the customers money so they make money without having to spend any time delivering the service? Incredible. I have removed all valid credit cards from this account so they can't steal more money from me, as they have proven they will do so. I have deleted their app from my phone. I have emailed them to have my account deleted, and I want nothing more to do with such a shady business. I will tell everyone I possibly can about this. They are a terrible, unethical company for stealing money from their loyal customers.\n",
      "I was charged $215 for a half hour trip. My phone died and I never relized I was going to pay that much. They suck you in with a cheap fare short distance then thay hit you hard with a big fare. Completely unfair and dishonest system. I will tell all my friends and family not to use this service.\n",
      "Called Uber for a ride to a local movie theater. It's only 7 miles away, but took us 30+ minutes. After the 10 a.m. movie, I logged on to Uber to get a ride home and found that my ride was still in progress! The driver was still on the clock for a 3+ hour ride. He was dozens of miles north. I canceled immediately and got a bill for $54! Unbelievable. Uber has not yet resolved the issue, but I am bewildered that something like this could happen.\n",
      "I've been driving for Uber in the Midwest for eight months. My average hourly income after gas is about $7/hr. On short trips, Uber takes about 50 percent of the fare.  In my city, that means I pocket $2.35 a ride.  The fifty percent comes from $1.80 Safe Ride charge and then 20% of what remains. You can expect 2-3 trips an hour. Longer trips are more profitable percentage wise, but not much.  During surge pricing 3X and up you can do ok, but surge times are limited and you can only expect a few surge rides a night.  Last night was very average for me.  Six hours, 100 miles, $40.  Two surge rides, but only 1.8X.  I'm sure some of the larger markets are better, longer average trips, more surge, etc, but not really worth the time in a city smaller than Dallas, Houston, etc.  The Uber concept is great for riders, drivers and mostly Uber.  I really enjoy driving for them.  I put this out there so any prospective driver knows what to expect.  I'm sure over time as Uber finds it harder and harder to find drivers that the compensation schedule will change.  Until then I'll just Uber around for beer money and call it good.\n",
      "I left a bag. It took a long time to answer my call. Their computers were down. Left my number. No call back. I just want my bag. No response. $#*!s.\n",
      "I drive for Uber in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I keep my car clean, inside and out, and often receive compliments on cleanliness. Uber drivers cannot be called from a time of more than 15 minutes from the pick up point, unless there is no other driver in the area. I have been called at 16 minutes without surge pricing. Speaking about pricing, in the Milwaukee area, the minimum charge is currently $5.25 (Uber X), of which the driver receives $3.20. The rate is based on $1.20/mile and $0.20/ minute (Uber X). Passengers often call Uber X when they should be calling an XL, but are rarely turned away. This does not give them a right to complain on that part. Customers are given estimates of the cost, as long as they put in the destination, and are notified if it is surging. They are allowed to cancel at any time, even after I arrive, without penalty. Fares can vary based on route taken, construction delays, accidents, and other traffic delays. I  end the trip immediately, as per Uber policy, when I mess up on the route, get stuck in traffic, or if the customer gets upset because of the trip. The customer is my number one priority, and I treat every passenger the way I would want them to treat me. The large part of my ridership is intoxicated college students, and they often get rowdy in my car. It takes alot of patience, which gets trying, to keep professional. If this doesn't sound like a job for you, please, don't apply to drive. I agree that there are problems with Uber, most freqently is due to GPS location with dropped pins. I suggest to manually enter your location of pick up and drop off, and contact your driver as soon as you get a conformation and verify your location. I notify all my passengers, when I arrive, of the address I am at to confirm my location is where they want me. For passengers, if you are expecting an Uber to arrive, please be ready, look for a message, and respond promptly. Drivers are paid per completed trip, not per hour, and do not make money sitting and waiting. Which is why I only wait 5 minutes after I arrive, unless the customer contacts me, responds to my message, or asks me to wait. I often get into a surging area, for pick up, and have to wait for a customer who never shows or cancels after I have been waiting. This is upsetting because I could be out picking up an actual person who needs my service. Drivers do not know where your destination is until he starts the trip, so we cannot decline to take you anywhere until we have already started the trip, after which we are committed to following through because the app does not allow us to cancel a trip in progress. I have never turned away a customer based on destination, nor for them needing my trunk space. I have picked up customers from grocery stores and helped them with their groceries, even carried them inside for them. I have picked up people for the airport and loaded and unloaded their luggage, and wished them a safe trip! In Milwaukee, Uber does not have privileges to pick up at Mitchell International Airport, or at least Uber X's. I often make trips from the downtown area to Waukesha, New Berlin, Greenfield, Grafton, Oak Creek, and Pewaukee. These fares are typically between $13 to $26 on non-surge rates. Those trips are between 15 and 25 minutes one way. My take on these trips average out to about a dollar per mile and Uber takes the rest.\n",
      "Well I've been reading the Uber reviews on here and they are hilarious. I just started driving for Uber this week. So far 5 trips. 90.33 for Uber. 66.50 for me. I don't think that's too bad. Could be better yes, but not bad. As a driver you can deduct all Uber mileage at the federal rate of .575 as of this review which will change your tax liability. This is a good thing. You will get to keep most of your money earned. I think the app works fine, would like to know where passenger is going before I take fare, but that's ok. I like the fact that I can drive when I want. I think most of these reviews are from taxi companies trying to take them out of business. No one ever is going to charge 300. for a 12 mile cab ride. You all are idiots. Uber is a great idea that I wish I would have thought of. Uber requires your car to be 2005 or newer. I'm sure there's a few Uber drivers that suck, but that is to be expected. Give bad reviews and they will be suspended. Cab companies beware I think your time has come...\n",
      "I started driving for uber. They take so much out of my far. I figured it out that after gas, I make less then minimum wage, and none of this includes wear and tear on my truck .I would not recommend it at all.\n",
      "Uber is nothing more than a scam. American Corporate Greed at it's Finest!!! Trust me I know....I drive for Uber!!! They say that Uber pricing \"surges\" (increases up to 10 times) based on supply (number of cars) and demand (number of request). I can tell you it's all BS! Uber raises prices when....it wants to! Doubt me? Take out your rider app....look at a area that is surging and see how many cars are in the area....now watch as more cars show up and maybe at best a small percentage of drivers get riders. I've literally seen Uber raise price up to 4.8 times normal rate and saw one out of ten drivers in the surge area get a ride. It's all BS and I have over 2,000 screenshots to prove it!!!! Rider and driver apps!\n",
      "My experience is much better than many of the reviews. The drivers I have had are friendly and helpful. Several times there has been a problem with the software but fare adjustment was done right away. I sent emails to customer support about problems in the software that had the driver going around in circles trying to get the software to start -- Resulting in me being charged $9.00 too much. I emailed customer service and received an adjustment to my debit card within 2 hours. No car company can be on time all the time especially in traffic. I live outside the city and commute to high traffic areas. I find UBER to be MUCH more reliable than yellow cab.\n",

You could take a ride in a Limo from the airport, I dare say it will cost $180.00 I cancelled my account and the customer service people does not know the difference between a complaint and a request.

      "we had a need to move a driver from our lot to the shop to bring buses back (after repair).  It seemed feasible to use Uber so noone had to drive the driver back and forth and waste time.  First time we use Uber, we were charged $19 for 6 miles distance (18 minutes drive).  Next time we were charged $15 for same mileage, same time.  Third time we were charged $36 for the same distance same time of travel.  We reached out to Uber to find out why and their reply was because a BLACK car showed up.  We had no idea about the scam they are running.  They sent a black car and doubled the price when we all needed was the cheapest ride from point A to point B.  This company is a rip off/scammer.  We will never use their services again and we do not recommend them either.  It would have been cheaper to just take a taxi for such close distance.\n",

When I got the finally bill, they put $104 as meter price and added 20% tip ($21) for the driver who doesn't even speak English. And also charged me $2 as \"booking fee\" thus to make the total bill as $128 as the driver initially reported. I was shocked that this is the company advertising not to take tips and now they added 20% tip by myself and billed me. No matter how many emails I sent to their customer support, nobody responded.

      "There are several things that annoy me about the Uber service in the Boston, MA area. (1) You cannot cancel an ordered drive when it becomes apparent that the driver of the car cannot seem to find where you are at despite phone calls and having past your drive area two to three times without having to pay for the cancellation because of the driver's outright ineptness. If I can track them as they pass by three times, so can The Uber network. It should be three times and you are out, period.\n",

This Uber driver is either lying or confusing us with someone else. It is wrong that Uber just automatically charges the customer without asking if it is correct and the driver should have to report it immediately or have the passenger acknowledge the incident. DO NOT use Uber. They could randomly charge your card! There isn't a customer service person to speak to either. You have to try to dispute the charge by email.\n",

Around 1 am I received a call from a young adult that had drank too much and was looking for a ride, she didn't even know where she was and had gotten separated from her friends. Not knowing where she was, I had her open her Iberia app. Within minutes a immigrant driver had her in his vehicle and got on the phone with me to assure me he would get her safely to me. 18 minutes later the driver delivered my passed out little friend. She may never drink again, but we will certainly Uber. Thank You Uber!\n",

Uber gives service that is only convenient for them.  They surcharge during busy times and do not show up.  If we accept businesses treating consumers like this, where will it end??  Are restaurants next to charge us double because we wish to dine at a busy time such as a Saturday night vs a slower Tuesday?  This type of treatment is not acceptable.  Think about it.\n",
      "I signed up with Uber about a week ago. My car is in the shop. I could not rent a car because I have a freeze on my credit report that I refuse to have lifted (that's another horror story). I set up my account with Uber and willingly gave them my billing information. I only wanted a ride to and from work. Well, the first ride worked fine. A tad expensive but I was not crying. The return ride was not set with the company because the account set up didn't allow for it (I booked on my home based iPad). The driver said he would pick me up from work and I could pay him. Although a tad expensive this too worked out ok. \n",

A normal cab fare is $60.00 and I was told much cheaper to use Uber so thought I would give it a try.  When we arrived at my house the meter fare was $81.00 which was ridiculous in of itself.  A short time later I received a notification that I was billed $156.31?  Beware ... your going to get ripped off.\n",

      "I recently used Uber got to see the pic of the driver who was coming to get me and my friends, when the driver pulled up she had someone in the passanger seat with her there was 4 of us guys for this Uber ride, she told me she didn't know there was going to be 4 of us and said the passanger was her husband and told him he would have to go to the bar while she dropped us of since there was 4 of us and needed his space too and would be back for him, this made me feel really awkward and now ill take a taxi before calling Uber\n",

Everything went well and, as always, when I arrived back home from the doctors I checked behind my seat to see if me or my dog left a mess behind. Which we DID NOT. The next day I go to my local pet store with my family to buy her treats and my card is declined. Turns out Uber charged my card $200!! I asked them why was that money taken out and they said the driver sent a report that my dog urinated and left feces in his car. I knew he was either lying or got the ride. So I simply told them they made a mistake and if they could please refund me back my money. \n",

The drivers are making money for UBER to be treated like crap.\n",
      "Worst experience I have ever had with customer service, and being screwed over with my money, and my time. With uber taking up to 25% of fare (which I am ok with and agreed to) They should by far be able to hire a few people to answer phones and solve problems. The fares randomly change with no explanation and no response from suppprt. A $25 far turns to a $20 fare out of thin air, and then on top of the missing $5 uber takes its 25%. Great idea and easy app, but many bugs and zero customer support to fix the issues. Just my though, but I was under the impression that the uber fee was for using their technology. Seems to me they need to take a little bit of that money out of their pocket and hire some people to help! _x000D_Ps. Not looking back for errors, why waste more time after 30 emails and no help.\n",
      "I have been using Uber for some months now and have always used the service to travel both into and out of the Melbourne CBD - usually travelling in at approx 8pm and returning around 3 or 4am in the morning.  The fee is always around $70-80 each way - except for this Saturday where the in bound trip was normal, however I was hit with a $134 bill on the way out,  This was due to a suprise 'dynamic pricing' fee that Uber apparently introduce when they want to encourage more drivers onto the streets.  I should have checked my 'price indication' however I didnt do this, because I had taken the trip so ofter (er...a couple of hours earlier) and no fee.  Driver did not advise of any fee and joke is on me because I didnt read the fine print.  Offer by Uber to refund only half of this $60 fee.  Not  good enough in my opinion.  I believe Uber knows that customers would opt for other alternatives if their customers clearly understood that a surprise fee could occur at random, which is why their method to inform is shady.  I feel completely ripped off and tricked into losing money I cannot afford to lose.\n",

I cancelled and booked another one he says he doesn't wanna go to the airport as it's far off.

Yeah fuk you Uber Customer Non Service. Oh and ps, I WILL NOT BE RETURNING ANY MORE LEFT BEHIND CELL PHONES OR WALLETS OR KEYS.

The background take about 7-10 days but then takes about an eternity. This is the worst experience I have had with an employer. It was a mistake - I shouldn't trust a company who doesn't have a human being to talk to.

Uber gets between 33% and 45% of the money, at the higher end on short trips, which are more common. And there is the waiting and drive time when you are off the clock! At least in my market (Twin Cities, MN) you are going to make about $10 to $13 an hour BEFORE EXPENSES. When you factor in gas, wear and tear on your car, tires, brakes, etc. you are likely making about $5 per hour! It is a fun job, flexible, interesting people, etc. But you can't make any money and you are using up your car. Uber is a great deal for the riders, and for Uber! I'm done with it.\n",

My Uber Driver exited off the fwy on one of the busiest streets, during the busiest times on a Friday... I requested to be dropped off, not inside the Forum Parking Lot but in the street since I only had 10 minutes to walk across the parking lot, go through security, and find my seats... Uber charged me $121.00 for one long ass ride, ahhh what happened to Your First Ride Is Free... After the concert I again request Uber... Same route it cost me $16 to get home, Yes SIXTEEN DOLLARS...

      "Just started using Uber during a trip to Seattle this Summer.  During that trip, had a chance to use Uber about a dozen different times.  Then a half dozen trips in Portland, Oregon.  Just got back from a trip to New York, where I used Uber extensively, as well as a few rides on a \"Yellow\" cab.  In every case, Uber was extremely convenient.  The vehicles were always on the new side, clean and comfortable.  The drivers were prompt, helpful (provided us with walking directions, information on places to check out, and warnings about areas that were \"sketchy,\" etc).  Because your ride is paid for automatically via the app, there is never any fumbling with cash, credit card reader systems, etc.  Just get to your destination and go._x000D_The iPhone app is a breeze to set up and use.  It allows you to chose the type and size of vehicle you need, lets you know how long you will have to wait for your ride, and gives real-time location updates on the Uber you have requested.  It also gives you the name and customer ratings of your driver before you book the ride, notifies you as soon as your Uber arrives to pick you up, and allows you to contact your driver via cell if there are any issues.  You are always asked to rate your last driver before you can book a new ride, which assures that Uber has extensive customer feedback, but can slow things down a bit if you are trying to book your next ride in a hurry._x000D_Our experience using \"Yellow\" cabs in many cities has not been great.  By and large, have always experienced long wait times when booking a cab by phone.  The standard seems to be \"your cab will be there in 15 to 45 minutes.\"  Usually, this works out to be 30 minutes plus.  Have also had issues with cabbies not wanting to do business with me when my ride is only a couple of miles or less.  In one case, had a cabbie whose car wouldn't start until AFTER we had gotten out of his car and jumped into another cab.  The cabs always seem to be \"vintage\" - at least five years old  - poorly maintained and on the gritty side.  Our last experience with a cab ride was from La Guardia to New York's financial district.  It was like the Long Beach Grand Prix meets destruction derby.  Lots of jackrabbit starts, swerving in and out of traffic at high speed, slamming on brakes - all in a car that hadn't seen new shock absorbers in about a decade.  My wife and  I were both motion sick, but were too freaked out by our fast and furious driver to try fixing our eyes on the horizon._x000D_All-in-all, I am sold on Uber.  Highly recommend it, and personally will never use a \"cab\" again unless I am forced to.\n",

The interior was no better, filth and grime was visible in the dashboard area. The car reeked of cigarette. When I asked the Driver if he had been smoking, all he did was fiddle with the A/C vents. After a while, he rolled down the window on his side slightly, I guess to reduce the cigarette smell, but that didn't really help. External heat and fumes came into the car, worsening the situation. I could hardly breathe and I developed a headache. My clothes still smell of cigarette.\n",
      "The driver was extremely incompetent. When I checked my email my charge was clearly wrong, instead of $17.93 it was $41.93 and destination was in Brooklyn which required toll charges and obviously longer route. I did not go to Brooklyn! Uber never reimbursed me. :((\n",

      "As a driver, the most frustrating element is that the app does not work well.  More often than not, it does not recognize that I have arrived at the pick-up point and can begin the trip.  So, rather than make the rider wait I will begin the trip.  But this means that the navigation system won't initiate to give directions.  And, just as frequently, the app doesn't recognize that you have arrived at the destination so you can end the trip.  Uber's answer is to employ a small army of workers to make adjustments to the ride beginning/ending and the associated fare after the fact.  When I first started with Uber (only two months ago), the app worked well (80% of the time).  Now, the above noted glitches occur 90% of the time.  Uber likes to send annoying reminder messages to the drivers.  Time and energy would be better spent fixing the navigation app.  Uber is losing drivers due to the hassles.\n",

UBER IS NOT GONNA CARE ABOUT YOU! It left me with option either to go with my insurance or Uber's, with $1000 deductible. And they won't charge the rider even damage fee... There always will be insurance gap, and this is not right! Uber takes $1 riders fee and 20% from the fare, and when our car is damaged, they sit back and sip the drinks! As a 2 year driver I am very disappointed! For riders, they will say the same thing about insurance. In the end, Uber cashes in the money and won't care about anyone when things goes bad!\n",
      "Forgot car/house keys in the car. Attempted to contact driver twice a few hours after the incident, he hung up on me both times after I explained why I was calling. Sent an email to uber with no response. Called Uber- voice message saying best way to contact is through email (obviously not). Went to uber headquarters-absolutely no help. The guy in charge of lost and found there said that he was not allowed to contact the driver. What can you do?!?\n",
      "When I started they said I needed an IPhone so rented one through them not realizing there were more hidden fees behind the $10/week charge for it. I added my 32 trips to over $300 and only received ~$50 total which only covered the gas and tolls I spent out of my pocket. Maybe if I'd stayed until the phone was paid off I, as a part-time driver around my full-time job and other responsibilities... I would have seen a profit. As of now I drove all them rides for FREE.\n",

Whilst the driver was friendly, he charged us $25 US to go a short distance...having caught a cab to the other side of New York and only charged $15 US it was obvious we were ripped off...not a good way to introduce visitors to New York.  We won't be using Uber ever again.\n",

      "Worst uber experience ever. The driver got on the freeway the wrong way going downtown when I needed to go uptown - didn't even realize his mistake. I was yelling at him to get off the freeway and 30 blocks out of the way he finally got off. And then I told him to stop the meter so he did, and then restarted it at that location. Ummmm excuse me, why should I be paying for 30 blocks OUT OF THE WAY. I just paid 30 extra blocks just to get back to where we started. And then I got charged for BOTH of those mistakes. In addition, when he finally got on the right freeway I had to direct his every step bc he wasn't paying attention and was on the verge of missing every freeway exit. The worst part - uber only refunded me the 8 dollars in the wrong direction and not for the extra 30 blocks back to my starting point. Horrible customer service uber. I shouldn't have to pay to get back to my starting point. I was so mad I took a taxi home instead of my usual uber.\n",

      "Uber the rating game_x000D_Hi, I was so excited when I heard about uber and  join the team I was very proud in one month I did at lease 50 trips. It started a little ruff in the beginning because you have to get to know the GPS and that sometimes it goes crazy in certain places and you don't know what to do but do my best to get the rider to his destination safe. So I had a few problems and some customers are not fair weather they are having a bad day or not feeling well or just disgusted with life itself. Uber should really try to communicate with there partners and see if they can help a driver and hear what they say about the passenger. I own a 2001 2 door Acura and I had to purchase a newer vehicle to drive and so the passengers were comfortable my way of providing good service. I did my best and that was not good enough because of how customers rated us and there comments. The sad part was that I rated almost everybody with a 5 star ratting. So I get an email that my account was deactivated . I was loving my job and was trying to improve without  Uber help. I lost a job I love due to customers with no heart and a company that does not care about the uber driver. _x000D_I hope this help someone and be careful cause the Uber driver has more to loose.

      "Between comparing themselves to airlines and hotels at peak  season who raise theirs rates which they do but never by 5.9 percent of a normal fare or room charge. Dynamic Pricking ,Surge charge and robot customer service with scripted replys they are a rip off.    They are not transparent at all in their pricing. They charged $250 at 11PM for a ride that cost $30 twelve hours earlier.  The driver took full advantage of the fact there were many riders looking for rides. There were also ample drivers available  He raised his surge until someone accepted. There was no disclosures or an idea that he was charging $250. It is not clear what surge charge is   It only states 5.9x.  5.9x of what.    When you take a ride twelve hours earlier for $30 no one would expect to pay $250 for the same ride.    Beware and make sure you know what you will pay before accepting a driver.  They are allowed to rake you over the coals\n",

That driver was given 1 star for not even attempting to contact me and for just driving by a couple of times. I was waiting outside before he got there.

He saw me and left.  _x000D_The last time I tried to use Uber again for a ride home from the grocery store (I contacted customer service about being left at the store the first time and was told that it would not happen again) Well, it did.

You start the day by putting $30 in gas so you figure no problem I will make it back and guess what you will but thats it.

Uber is a wake up call if you have ended up here your life is not going as planned. You need to change course I find myself scared to go eat off the dollar menu cause it will take me several fares to make it back.

On my second trip I was to get picked up by a Akeem Davis and when I loomed his up a ton of red flags were popping up.

      "Uber use to be great. Remember when you got the first one? It was so easy and convenient. Now, they are worse than taxi's. Surge charging to 2 or 3+ times the normal rate, app crashes, poor drivers, and above all, weak and unhelpful customer service. Now any d bag with a license can be a driver. Some of the drivers even pedal coke and weed thru Uber. Other drivers hit  on girls and try to get dates. We had a driver pick us up in his pajamas once. Another driver had a tire blow out and told us there was nothing he could do about it and we basically paid double for the trip since we had to order another uber. This is no longer a company that is in control. Uber use to be great. They use to be the Nordstrom of transportation. Now, you might get the first car you click, or maybe the app will crash. Maybe the driver will wait 10 minutes then call you and cancel the ride because he's stuck in traffic. Once you get the car, cross your fingers for a cool knowledgeable driver but 9 times outta 10 the driver is out of their area and they have no idea where they are. So use gps, but it doesn't help when gps takes you the \"shortest\" and most traffic ridden route. After your trip, hopefully you get charged the correct amount... Or maybe the driver will contact uber and say your trip was longer than it actually was and they will charge you more, which I hear is happening more often now. At least taxi drivers have to work out your transaction on the spot and you know you won't be charged more at a later time. Taxi drivers are also usually driving as a career, supporting their family, barely scraping by. One of my last uber drivers was a real estate agent using uber to give out his friend number to order weed. WTF? Uber USE TO be great. Now, I'd rather just take a taxi. The uber app is convenient, but is it that much harder to dial a cab??\n",

It cost us over $700 to rebook another flight 2 days later. To make things worst, we were charged 235 euros for the trips and the time it took us to file a police report. I complained to Uber and some lady responded with simple sorry, saying I left my bag on street which of course I did not and it wasn't some public street and I recall very well telling driver to put in tunck and use back seat for larger case. Today and I am in NewYork I missed a call from Paris followed by an email which I responded to both but no answer on phone and still waiting for another call. My total losses are at least $4000 .

      "I have driven for UBER in Kansas City for over 1 year.  I have also assisted with the regulatory process by testifying in Jefferson City State House and have participated in a number of Uber charitable/community events in KC.  The greater Kansas City Missouri and Kansas metropolitan area people just LOVE riding with Uber and truly appreciate the higher level of service and safety that Uber delivers over the archaic taxi services.  Uber is also a very good company that treats its drivers with great respect.  The Uber app for Driver Partners is simply amazing and has evolved to include trip details, earning summaries and great rewards that rival many US Fortune 100's offerings.  As to earnings, Uber provides a real opportunity for drivers to make good money doing a highly rewarding job on a full-time or part-time basis.  At first, Uber will enter a market with a much lower price than the taxi services to help boost the customer base but they are also smart enough to know that price increases are also necessary to reflect the higher level of service that Uber delivers while still providing personal transportation at lower prices than taxis.  With the latest revolution in Kansas and Missouri Taxi Code to solidly position Uber in Kansas City for the longterm, drivers should expect to make hourly rates in excess of $30 per hour due to increased demand.  It's great to see that Uber, and Uber Riders, has elevated the job of driving for personal transportation to an attractive opportunity for students, single parents, single-mothers, veterans, ex-taxi drivers and anyone who wants to sup,went their income or make a good salary on a full-time basis.

Trips to the airport are common this time of the morning.  LAX trips at least 5 times a week. Before 9:00 am i have made around 50.00 Take a break until I feel like it. Drive mid to late afternoon in by 8:30 pm I just made 120.00_x000D_I average 700.00 a week x 4 equals 2800.00  Nice little addition to my V.A. disability. You have to run this as a business. You dont drive you dont get paid period end of story. If you have problems with the navigation how about changing what your using. Waze is awesome with the Uber app. _x000D_I don't see how anyone can consider this as being an employee. I work when I want to. I take off for vacation when I want to. No one is in charge of me to tell me when  to drive or where to drive. And for those of you who complain about the maintenance on your car. Well, You should be keeping the maintenance on it any way. No wonder most of you got engine trouble. Using your car while working is a huge tax advantage.  Oh insurance.... You are required by law to have that any way. A little extra coverage may be required but to me its worth it. _x000D_Some drivers have bad experiences with  driving for Uber. If you drive in a bad area guess what you gonna get bad riders. But alas!  You have control of who gets in your car. Boot em out. Say thanks but no thanks and go on about our business. I drive in a very good area and in business areas.

It reained yesterday, and being unsuccessful in getting a cab, I contacted Uber. Oh the driver showed up, took one look at all the stuff I was bringing back and immediately canceled the job.  Uber said it would try and find another car for me, which it never did.  I ended up calling a friend to come and get me.  Beware of this company\n",
      "I have got a Rs 300 free ride valid up to 31st July 2015. I have booked a ride and it cost me Rs 277. Then also Uber fraudulently deducted this amount from my paytm account without informing me and also charged a free ride. Uber is a fraud company. Please don't take services. Company should be banned from India. When I reached its customer center they said we can do nothing as all process is computerized. Please boycott such a fraud company.\n",
      "I have to say this is going to be my first and last time I ever use this service. I am going to be writing on every site possible about the terrible scam that is UBER cabs! Claim to be the cheapest but on the night out at 2am when we were trying to book it wouldn't let us change the surcharge and anything less than 2.4 wouldn't get accepted. As a customer being my first time with uber and trusting that it should still be cheap I booked. Only to realise I ended up paying £102 for a ride which has never been more than £40!!!! Biggest biggest scam ever and never ever am I gonna use this service! After complaining that the driver took a bad route I was given an email saying the estimate was rigt??? Maybe uber should check facts! Never has a cab ride from London to Harrow costed me more than 40! Worst company ever!!they claim that they give an estimate of the fare! Don't be fooled no such thing happened! The next thing we know is driver is on his way and once we get home we receive the huge a** receipt! STAY AWAY!\n",
      "Not only is \"UBER\" car service a fraud but actions that are allowed by its passengers are criminal!!! Recently, my friends son was jumped by passengers riding in an \"UBER\" vehicle. When the incident happened I couldn't believe a \"reputable\" car_x000D_Service would allow such criminal acts and not file a report. So sad...\n",
      "I thought this was very practical until my card was fraudulently charged twice tonight and I discovered how ridiculously difficult it is to do anything about it! I saw the ride come up and cancelled the first one, but I got charged anyway because it was cancelled at the last minute - to the tune of £17! I emailed UBER support right away but they are not available during the late night, it seems. I have changed my password and sent another email asking to delete my account but am afraid I will get charged again despite it all. Why is it not possible to take the credit card off the site? I don't want to go through the hassle of cancelling my card when it's just an UBER problem. If the site just offered that option I wouldn't be deleting my account. But now I'm totally turned off UBER and will stop using them asap.\n",

Yes there are surges at times when their are more people needing us then drivers available. I find the social aspect very rewarding Im satisfied just be smart about it and its a win win situation. Remember don't get crazy with your income from it. Take into consideration you have to pay taxes and car maintainence. I absolutely love it..._x000D_Leighton\n",

      "I booked a ride from Radisson blu Tonk road to Nahargarh fort in Jaipur in India. While booking the ride, both pick up and drop points were specified._x000D_Even when we hopped in the cab, we told the driver specifically that we need a drop to nahargarh fort._x000D_However, when we reached amber road just at the bottom point to Nahargarg and jaigarh fort (both on same way) the driver stopped and said this is the last point. He refused to drop us to the fort (any nearby fort). He asked us to get down at a point where there was absolutely no other transport service. It was scorching hot and disturbing. He did not move from that place. He said officially, this is the last point and we are not permitted to go beyond this point. A local auto fellow came and said he can give us a ride._x000D_We kept requesting the driver to drop us till the fort but he said we are not allowed to go beyond this point. He said  beyond this point he can take personally and asked us to pay him Rs. 300 just to drop us till the nahargarh fort gate. We repeatedly told him to drop us to the fort gate but he refused and said either we should get down here (point which was 9kms before the fort gate) or pay him 300 and go. He also asked us to decide fast as the waiting meter is running and we are being charged for it._x000D_We were left with no choice but to get down in the middle of no where. We also did it because of anger and disappointment.  Luckily, we found the auto guy whom we anyways had to pay Rs.500._x000D_We felt cheated and harassed. This is absolutely wrong work ethics and I am extremely disappointed with uber service because of today's experience. _x000D_I would also like to bring to your notice that the invoice that I have been sent, I have been charged Rs.200 entry fee for amber fort which I never went to._x000D_It seems the uber app is still not able to track and locate its vehicles pick and drop locations._x000D_Having a female co-passenger the driver should also be careful and not drop us in a deserted location. _x000D_I am extremely angry and I want to give negative rating to the driver as well as the uber services.\n",

      "I promoted Uber with my friends and gave free trips, I used more trips with money initially. At the time of using free trips, Uber disable all the free trips and not providing proper answer for their task. They are saying like promoting uber is your big mistake\n",
      "I have used Uber four times now. Every time I use Uber I have had an excellent experience. The drivers are professional and the cars are nice. You get what you pay for and I will never take a taxi again. It's Uber all the way\n",
      "I Took an uber from one location to another I was totally overcharged. When I got out of the uberwhen  I realized I forgot my wallet. When we called The driver he dropped it off with $240 missing out of it. When I called to complain to uber they basically completely ignored me and said it was his word against mine. We spoke with the Uber driver in detail and asked him to return the $240 and he basically said no. We have made a police report and are following up and hopefully will get some results. A lesson learned take a taxi instead of an Uber.\n",
      "My uber driver was on his phone, driving very slow, incompetent of following directions. It was almost as if he didn't care (he most likely doesn't care with these rules of habits) over all I'm never using this service again unless its on someone else's dime!!!\n",
      "Its been over 2 weeks since I made numerous trips that I STILL have yet to be paid for. There is no human to get ahold of to complain to. They just send you a default email telling you that they're looking into it, and thats the end of it. Worse customer support than Time Warner Cable! Im done wasting my time and gas with this half-assed, poorly managed, joke of a company. I look forward to the day they get shut down for some illegal business doings.\n",

At first you think \" my goodness, what are they searching for?\" _x000D_I drove with them for 3 days, I started to feel like something was off. It was TOO EASY< TOO CONVENIENT. then during a morning pickup, the app ( Uberpartner app for drivers) stopped working. No warning, no nothing! Then, I tried to log out then back into the account...... this message followed; \" Your driver account has not been activated\" I drove using the app for 3 days, how is that possible??!!!! Again, no warning, no explanation, and certainly NO PAYMENT for my work yet. _x000D_They seem to hide behind the convenience of the internet so you can't actually \"reach\" them which to me means NO ACCOUNTABILITY whatsoever. _x000D_There have been a few rapes reported, banned in different countries and cities.....and nothing seems to happen...no statements and when they do make one.....its very VAGUE..... I absolutely will never use that (so-called-service) again....\n",
      "While on vacation to Miami in Jan 2015, I decided to try Uber since taxis can be quite expensive.  I downloaded the app and filled out all necessary information. Little did I know that one of their drivers would scam me and Uber condones this behavior. _x000D_My friend she lives in North Miami and we were going to South Beach. I ordered an Uber (Uber X showed up) for pick-up at approximately 9pm. North Miami to South Beach was $18.39. No problem with this fare.Got out of the Infinity SUV and we were on our way.Fast forward to two days later when I receive an email from Uber saying they made a fare adjustment. An adjustment in the amount of $175 for a cleaning fee. The driver filed an incident report with photos included stating I vomited in his vehicle. Photos that have no time or date stamps. There was no incident, his report is false. I have a witness who will attest that no incident occurred. I'm still disputing the charge in the amount of $175. Uber thinks it fine to allow one of their drivers file a false incident report against a customer and condones his dishonest behavior.  Way to value your customers Uber!!\n",
      "March 2015 I took a trip to New York. A coworker suggested I try the Uber app. Trip one, the pick up at the airport, the driver was sitting in the wrong place and expected me to walk to him at the other end of the terminal. Trip 2 a short ride from my hotel was $20, when a yellow cab for the same trip was $8. The driver again stopped midway down the block and parked in front of another hotel. It took him 25 minutes to find me, when the APP showed his car making circles around the blocks nearby. Trip 3 the driver did not know where to go to find Broadway and Lafayette. Uber drivers use their personal cars to pick up a few fares. They don't know the normal taxi protocols, and it cost be double or more for each local ride. Yellow Cabs are still a great service, with professionals who may not have fancy black cars, but have expertise in driving.\n",

      "I have had THEE worst experiences with Uber. If they are not driving past me and then charging me a cancellation fee, driving recklessly with my kids in the car, barely speaking English, or purposely driving out the way to increase the fare. I also had a driver that was supposed to take me to the Southwest terminal at Ronald Reagan. He drove passed the terminal and almost out of the airport. When I asked him where he was going he started driving in reverse in busy rush hour airport traffic. I then told him to stop at which point he told me to get out his car and left me, my fiancee, and our bags in the middle of the street. The pictures below are screenshots of the fares I took from my hotel to the San Diego Convention Center. The first one is the fastest and correct way to get to the Convention Center. The second photo clearly shows the twist and turns the driver took and then when I complained told me to get out and I had to walk the rest of the way! From where my hotel was all the driver had to do was drive straight down West Ash and then make a left on Harbor.\n",

      "I used Uber from San Diego Airport going to an interview. I was very frustrated because Uber won't work using my Cellular Service! You have to find \"hot spot wi-fi\" connection otherwise you can't login to UBER! I almost missed my interview due to the poor UBER connection from the airport! The first driver cancelled because we couldn't text each other again due the poor connection. I had to wait for a second driver. Back in Phoenix (from San Diego), I had the same internet issue on my iphone. I gave up requesting the UBER service and took a regular cab! Hence, I agree with other reviewers, the UBER idea is great but execution is miserable!\n",
      "I was totally ripped off by an incompetent driver who wasted 25 mins of my time so I missed a paid appointment and got charged 35$ for what should have been a 20 fare.  After 4 attempts they finally credited me 4$ .... Are you kidding!! They didn't even read my text complaint.  Total losers... Take a real taxi.\n",

      "One driver in the Dallas area actually had the gall to post a rant on Craigslist about how he feels about his passengers because they don't tip.  His own words were, \"...you are a cheap a** bas**** ....\"  Isn't NOT tipping part of their advertising?  Aren't low rates supposed to be part of their attraction?  When I contacted him, he was even more vulgar and said he was only driving part time.  Thank goodness for small favors, I guess!  With drivers like these, why would anyone even bother with these headaches?  With attitudes like these, I'm guessing these people just can't get a real job anywhere else......\n",
      "I thought they were good until one night I took use of Uber from Milwaukee Airport.  Before I selected what type of care service I wanted from Uber, I immediately got a phone call from an Uber Driver - which I thought was very odd as all other times they responded a few minutes AFTER I finished choosing the car type and then submitted.  A black car - a Lincoln Towncar showed up.  I was charged $55.00 just from the airport to West Allis.  I was expecting to pay about $20.00 which is what I paid on the way to the airport 5 days earlier.  After complaining to the company  all they said was that I chose the Black expensive car -  even though I never even had a chance to choose type of car on the APP  - the company said they already paid the driver so they could not do anything about it.  I think the driver knows how to intercept the signal as soon as you log into the APP - BEWARE!\n",
      "I would not recommend Uber to anyone. Its like a scam. They lie about the estimated rated that your ride will be. They charge you double or triple the price a regular cab service will charge you. I used uber for the first time 2 weeks ago and when i look at my receipt, my destination was not where my driver had left me. I sent them an email and they had claimed a refund of $17 was going to be refunded into my account. Until this day i still have not received my refund. Plus they have your credit card information but no phone number for their riders to call?? Its like they hide behind the internet and you just have to hope someone responds to your email. I will never use this service again.\n",
      "Works ONLY if you are LEAVING a major metro area. Any suburban stuff, just call a cab. My driver showed up reeking of meth, ran over a median strip. Wildly insane service. Plus, try calling any time that's not convenient. \"NO DRIVER AVAILABLE\". F-this.\n",
      "We used Uber for the first time last night ... thankfully we had a $30.00 first time rider credit that covered our trip to American Airlines Center. We had an awesome trip to the Mavericks game and we loved our driver and the rate was reasonable; however, when the game was over and we went to the app to get a ride home they had a \"surge fee\" and they were now charging 5 times the normal rate. We waited thinking the surge rate would go down after the game had been over for a while and even signed up to be notified when the surge was over. Two hours after the game we had a nice bartender at Pira Lounge help us get a ride. We had to pay $60.00 for a 20 min ride home with In Style Limo Service, but Uber would have been over $100.00 plus tip. Ridiculous. So people beware that they suck you in with a very reasonable fee then upcharge you with a \"surge\" fee that can happen at any time and leave you stuck or paying way too much. We never received notice when the surge was over either. I will NEVER use them again. Our poor dogs were 2 1/2 hours past due going out - I was livid being stranded with no reasonable way home.\n",
      "The idea of the company is great-- but the execution is terrible. The \"surcharges\" are the most ridiculous charges I have ever seen. I have paid $25 for a gross taxi ride, but that surely beats a $118 uber ride, for the same mileage, time, etc. No amount of snacks, water, or nice vehicles can ever make up for the ridiculous charges. I have had 4+ terrible experiences with both myself or friends with insane upcharges & shady \"end trips\". While I have also had good trips (at 4 pm on a Monday, or 9 pm on a Friday), the absolute exorbitant fees will surely keep me away!\n",

You can receive $100 after sign up type in my referral code: 1W99G. Enjoy it guys it's not like any other boring job, trust me.\n",
      "I was told to downloaded the app to receive a $20 dollar coupon, which i did. i ordered a ride and before getting in the car i made sure to double check with the driver that i was not going to be charged a single thing (my destination was only 5 miles away). everything went well until the day after i noticed that they had charged me money. the coupon i had was applied but they had also charged me with an extra surge fee that i never approved of! they do not have a customer phone number so i had to email them. they never helped me with my problem. i DO NOT recommend this company at all!\n",

We were coresponding via text so i coukd help him find the place, i went out side to flag him down, and not a soul was out there. only three minutes had past.

      "I'm a soon to be ex-driver for Uber. I know exactly how it works, and I can honestly say this is the worst company that I've ever encountered in over a half-century on the planet. The CEO recently stated in an interview (video available online) that the AVERAGE driver salary is $100,000/year!! I probably couldn't GROSS that in (4) years and working ~70 hours/week, and it would take nearly twice that to bring that kind of money home. They're about lies, greed, and not taking any responsibility. You should know - if you ever have any problems with Uber, and you most likely will, there is no customer service to call (and they have your credit card information).

      "Uber is no better in Berlin, Germany. I recently signed up for their service and am now completely appalled at how deceitful and shady their business practice is. At NO point is it made clear to the consumer that one must pay for a full taxi fare when choosing the taxi option. Plus, the app makes it too easy to choose this option without explaining that the private driver option is only available on the weekends (at least here in Berlin that is the case)._x000D_Due to this, I inadvertently ordered a taxi. And even when I inquired to the cab driver what the cost would be, I was told it would only be 1.50. It ended up being 15 plus._x000D_This kind of sneaky business practice is simply intolerable. $#*! them.\n",

      "recently signed up with Uber; first time tried to use was in Miami area; drivers never showed up ($35 cab ride back to hotel), emailed and complained to Uber, they sent email back telling me that they reset my phone number and now everything SHOULD work; tried again next evening, went out to dinner with friends, once again used Uber app and sure enough it sent me to another window asking if I would pay SURGE, first time said NO, then immediately sent to another page asking \"ARE YOU SURE\" said NO once again, then was informed car on way, waited outside of restaurant 15+ minutes and NO Uber, hailed taxicab ($40) back to hotel.  Then next day found $55 cancellation charge on credit card...thank goodness Wells Fargo understood and removed charge, Wells Fargo agent said they have had several of these experiences\n",
      "I have been a loyal uber user since they first launched in NYC area. I had no serious complaints until recently. Like many other users on this site, i was charge over $250 on Halloween for \"surge rates\" which in my opinion are a complete SCAM. the notification about the rate surge was not clear in october, and the management team did nothing to help besides credit $30. TOtal BS! I used Uber again last evening during the rain and a total of 8 miles was $225!!!! How is it even legal to charge that amount for an 8 mile trip? Not only was the trip 8 miles, but the driver went in the opposite direction to avoid some congestion, which resulted in double the mileage. The car was described to be a mercedes benz R class, and when it arrive it was a black town car. If it says Mercedes, a mercedes should arrive. Also, i will be using yellow cabs from now on. the is no regulation with Uber, it seems they can just charge whatever fare they please and then send you an exhorbitant receipt. i now see why the far isnt disclosed as you are driving with uber driver bc most times there would be an argument on the spot if it was! SO many unfair business practices, i will be filing complaints wherever i can possibly file them. There must be more consumer protection and awareness for these type of scams. Not to mention the Uber X drivers are not insured as they should be- driving with personal plates and no commercial insurance coverage. Shame on you uber!\n",
      "had to change my existing credit card with Uber for some reason.  This change has been a disaster.  have done atleast 3 times a scan of my card, uber has taken mandatorily some INR 70 bucks, which i have been assured will be netted in my first ride.  Sadly, the verification against the same card has happened 4 times, but on requesting for a ride, Uber promptly tells me that the card is invalid.  Now the same card i use everywhere online and is being accepted is making me worry whether UBER is already over capacity and not taking new customers as it cannot service and giving arbitrary reasons for NO SERVICE.\n",

      "My fault for NOT researching better...  Uber has ZERO customer service..  Imagine to my surprise, NO numbers to call customer support with a problem..  NO way to cancel service online... NOT any advice about how to cancel service ... NO ride verification.  With all the negative responses that I am seeing everywhere online, I will be  surprised if they are still in business for long... Pitiful excuse for a company...  Typical GREED! Only in America, and now international...  This company redefines the meaning of BUYER BEWARE!\n",
      "Firstly there is the service.  One day you might get a ride with someone who speaks the same language as you and is driving a clean vehicle that isn't dented, rusting or doesn't stink like the 9th circle of hell inside but that will be a RARE day if you ever do.  Secondly, If you find yourself outside of their preferred pick up areas, you are not going to get a ride or you will wait longer than you wold have for a taxi or legal rideshare.  Third, THERE IS NO INSURANCE.  Uber is falsely advertising that they actually have insurance, their TOS page invalidates any and all coverage for you once you get in the vehicle.  Fourth, their surge pricing scam is obviously NOT about a lack of supply or demand or they wouldn't be dropping the surge price once a few of their drivers have picked up people at THREE times the normal rate in the same area.  It is a method of keeping their vehicles in one area so Uber can collect more fees from their drivers.  It has nothing to do with customer service or actual demand and it destroys the green factor of the service as it puts twice as many vehicles on the road than would be needed.  This isn't even a real rideshare company. It is just a crappy point to point service.   If you do not care about your own safety or the safety of those you travel with or the planet, this is the service for you.\n",

      "They also charged me over $100 on Halloween night for a 10 minute drive. If I would have know the surge charge would have been this much I would have called a different cab service. What's interesting is that same night we got a different Uber driver and they did not have a surge charge. So I'm guessing it's up to the ass hole driver. But regardless I will not be using Uber ever again. I'm a poor college student who was just trying to be responsible on Halloween night and not drink and drive. But $114 cab rides I cannot afford.

      "UBER is a SCAM w/ there surge explosions. I took Uber on Hallowen and was given a pe-quote of $20-$40.. You can imagine my surprise when I saw a charge of $136.40 to my bank acct.  I tried to dispute this cost but I was basically told I was SOL.  I will never recommend UBER to anyone, I will never use UBER ever again and I will use the old fashioned way to travel if I am going to party......VIA TAXI CAB..  BTW I think UBER creates their own high demand times as I was charged the $136.40 at 7:30 pm and for the ride home at 12:30 am only cost $32.99 HHMMMMMMM.....I hope this company fold and goes under as they are ripping innocent people off....and if you work for UBER you are at fault too...

It was only when the receipt was emailed to him that he realized the fare was so high! Tonight (11/03) on WRAL 11 PM news there will be a story on Uber overcharging passengers. Let's all speak up and teach these companies that they cannot take unfair advantage of riders!\n",
      "F*ck Uber. They have horrible business ethics and refuse to take any accountability for their actions. They are on par with rapists because they surge prices at peak times when people are the most drunk and most likely to misunderstand something and they take advantage of people's drunkenness to rob them of their money. Not only that, they refuse to accept the fact that they made a mistake and they refuse to fix it. They charged me a surge price and I never accepted it. Nothing ever appeared on my phone screen giving me the option to accept or deny the surge. No matter how drunk I am, I would have denied the surge and walked home or gotten another taxi service.\n",

I deleted the app LAST WINTER and it charges me EVERY DAY for charges of $5.00, $5.18, $5.23, $6.85, $9.30 WHICH CAN REALLY ADD UP! I am a college student and they are TAKING MY MONEY STILL!!! No phone line doesn't help either.

Saving a few dollars isn't worth all the nonsense I just went through.\n",
      "This is a follow up to my previous review. In Dallas Uber has further increased their cut of the total take while reducing the cost of a ride. Now Uber charges 80 cents per ride, a dollar and 70 cents for their fee per ride which they take off the top and 20 percent of what is left. Thus a minimum ride (a ride under 4 miles) will attract an Uber charge of $5. The driver gets a gross of 2 dollars and 60 cents while Uber takes 2 dollars and 40 cents. If you are unlucky enough to give a ride to an SMU student, the would order you to take them to a fast food place usually a mile or one and a half away. They make you go through the drive through. If it is whatasaburger be sure you will spend anywhere between five to ten minutes waiting in line with your car running. Afterwards they eat in the car, spill drinks, food, leave trash, and jump out of your car after you drive them back with out tipping. Guess how much is your gross? It is a wopping 2 dollars and 60 cents. I used to get so worked up about it, and I am not usually able to hide my feeling about it such that I usually get a 1 star rating from those students. Somebody would say if you hate it so much why not quit. I will tell you why. I joined Uber 2 years ago. At that time my second wife had just died of multiple sclerosis. I still had two teenagers and an 11 year old at home. I had to find something that would be flexible. At that time Uber was advertising $35 dollars an hour for Uber X. If you really do the math you will realise that even if it was true, it is not much. Because the amount was merely gross. And the hourly mentioned was driving hours after you have picked up a client. It does not include the time spent in your car running the engine and waiting for Uber call. Neither does it include distances driven to pick up passengers. If the client cancells after you get there then it does not count. So I decided that Uber black was the way to go. You make fewer rides and much more money. So I contacted Uber. Asked about car requirements. With their approval I took 48, 000 dollar loan to buy a car. When I tried to register it as Uber black I could not. I sent an email and h ot a reply encouraging me to register it as Uber X and then open another email and register it as Uber black. I tried to do that but it was all a lie. A year later somebody at Uber finally told me that they stopped registering Uber black in the same month that I was asking them if it was okay to buy my car to use as Uber black. To cut the long story short I had to run the car as Uber black. Later Uber came up with Uber Select and they let me register and for a while it was better. Uber sellect cost about twice the cost of Uber X. I switched to only Uber Select. Pretty soon Uber ordered all Uber Select to also do X or be turned off. Then t hey systematically began to kill off Uber Select business by always surging the price of Uber select. The alternative is to flip burgers, but it will not pay for my 900 dollar a month car loan. So I am forced to spend a gazillion hours (at least twelve) to be able to earn anything between 100 and 200 dollars gross per day. Thete that is why am still doing it until I find an alternative. What irks me most is the fact that everbody blames the drivers. The press make Uber drivers the villain. They do not know the city, they are not curteous, they are dishonest, etc. But who advocates for them? Who sincerely wonders how they make ends meet? What about the American tradition of tips? Why should it not apply to Uber drivers? Some will say why do they do it if it is so bad? I have told you my reason. But now let us look at it broadly. Maslow's hierarchy of needs? It suggests that a human has 5 needs that must be satisfied in a hierarchical order begining from the lowest to the highest. In order to satisfy these needs humans do what they must. However when one lower need is satisfied the next in hierarchy becomes a need. A very hungry man will even for to work for food. That does not mean that he is willing to work gor food only. As soon as he is full he will want other things like clothes, shoes, housing, etc. A person pressed to a corner would work for Uber no matter how low his take. Uber knows that that is why there was a time they would pay up to 800 dollars to get you convince friend or family to work for Uber. Now they pay 300 dollars. So when you get some one not knowing the city do not just give him a bad rating. Be gracious. It is only a gracious person that will give dignity and not take it away. That poor guy is trying his best to follow his American dream not knowing that he/she is a mere hapless pawn in the hands of the great shark called uber who pleases and woes her customers by using her drivers as mere fodder. I have much more to say but am afraid this is becoming too long. However I cannot resist wondering what holds us together as a nation. Our military are known for leaving no one behind. Why would we close our eyes to the plight of fellow Americans? Not long ago Apple was being taken to task for making their phones in China and paying very low wages why do we let Uber mistreat so many our country men and we keep quiet? It is cheap yes but would you sell your family for cheap stuff? Are we truely a Nation or have we gone back to the land of France before revolution? Are we gone back to creating bourgeoisie and the peasants classes all in the name of cheapness and convenience? Thanks for reading._x000D_Okonkwo\n",
      "Overall, I have enjoyed Uber as a passenger.  Unfortunately though, I recently had a bad experience with a driver and the customer service was worse.  I'm a loyal customer (having taken 28 trips for $900 in just 30 days) and was quite offended at how they handled this.  Overall, I love Uber but I am sincerely disappointed about how they handled my complaint._x000D_On October 14, 2014, I requested Uber at 7 a.m.  The driver FLEW past my house and I tried to call them twice to ask them to turn around and come back as they just parked at the end of the block.  The driver didn't answer so I walked a block and a half to get my Uber._x000D_When I got into the car, I was overpowered by the scent of BO and/or some other offensive odor.  I don't think the driver had it but the car was full of the smell.  ugh, I walked a block and a half for this pleasure . . . _x000D_We then started our trip.  By the time we hit the Steelyard curve on 176, she was chatting away at me (not bad in and of itself EXCEPT . . .) and looking at me while she spoke.  I looked ahead at the line of brake lights ahead of us and shrieked!  We came within INCHES of rear-ending the car ahead of us!  YIKES!_x000D_After that, she drove 50 mph on the highway for the duration of our smelly trip._x000D_I contacted uber that afternoon and the first guy said \"sorry about your experience\" and that was it . . ._x000D_The second person said \"we'll talk to grace and I'll look into it\" but I heard nothing further._x000D_The third person said  and this is a direct quote from her email: Sorry to hear that! We'll be sure to follow up with Grace to check in and share this concern. Again, thank you for taking the time to write in, I've added $10 credit to your account for the trouble. While it doesn't make up for the experience we hope this will allow you to have a better one in the future._x000D_Yeah, Amber - you're right, it doesn't make up for the experience.  Bad enough you don't even have a loyalty/frequent rider program but after your credit, I still paid $25+ for that ride?_x000D_They don't have a phone number either so you can't call anyone to complain.

      "I was an Uber driver in Raleigh,NC for 2 months a couple months after the launch just to check out what all the hype was about. First and foremost, driving for Uber is like working for about $10/hr(maybe) when you do the math. Uber charges riders in Raleigh $1.20 per mile. They pay their drivers 80percent of that or .96/mile. That is a mathmatical fact.As a driver,when you pick-up a passenger and drive them to their destination, you have to drive back to the hot pick-up area to get another fare.That's a fact. Raleigh is not New York City where you can pick up a rider,drive them across the city, and pick up another fare 5 blocks away. In Raleigh, you pick-up a rider, drive them 10 miles away,and then drive back the same 10 miles to get another fare(typically in downtown or local concerts etc). I did it and I know. I even camped out at the airport for 2 weeks from 7AM-10AM when 35 flights typically come in from big Uber markets. Very few calls to drive and I positioned myself so that I would be the first to be called because of an area I know about very close to the terminals. Back to the nasty math that Uber hates to talk about.Your .96/mile is now half that or .48/mile,because you have to drive back to pick-up another passenger. Gas in an efficient car is .15/per mile that you drive. Bro, now you are down to making .33/mile. Hardly what I call a good job part-time or otherwise considering you are wearing out your car driving people around. No BS what I have just told you here.Just the facts.1/16/2015 UPDATE!!!! Uber has now dropped their rider fees to .75/mile in Raleigh!! Amazing. Take everything I stated above regarding the money you can make at Uber as a driver and reduce it by over half now. They have added a bogus hourly guarantee(with conditions that are not within your ability to control)and have the gall to state that they are looking out for the drivers. Most drivers are actually losing money driving for Uber now,when they factor in gas and car expenses,nevermind making any money.People....You need to have your heads examined if you continue driving for Uber. Regards.\n",

      "It sure can be a great experience for riders, but not so for drivers. Uber advertises $18-35 an hour while driving for Uber, but it's not true at all. I drove for 6 hours last night and I made like $90, and I was busy. See, while one can get a lot of riders, many just want to hop a few blocks away, which is not worth it for the driver at all. The fare will be just about $3.20 or so, or $5.50? Taking into account that maybe I drove more than a few blocks to pick up that rider just to take him/her 5 blocks away?  Minimum flat fee should be at least $6 to make it worth picking them up. I actually have a rider whose fee was $3.20. But the driver has no way to know in advance these things, otherwise I won't pick up that person.  Let's do the math, last night I made 90 - %20 to uber = 72, now 72 - 17gas = 55. Now 55 - 10 a day for car lease = 45 Now $45/ 6 hours shift = $7.5 which is less than minimum wage. Sure there are nights or days when you get a bit more, but that still be around $12/hour, other days average pay might be $15/hour or so, but no where near $35 an hour. In addition, if my car goes over the mileage limit from the lease I will pay 15 cents a mile and driving for Uber my car WILL go over the limit. Uber, should increase the prices to make it worth for the drivers, and riders before you complain the driver this and that and before you give such a low ratings, think about the privilege you have by using Uber, and how this ride might be at the drivers expense.\n",
      "I have used it several times-maybe 6-7 and I found it to be easy and painless. I like the idea that I know what I am paying before they arrive, thus its my choice to use or not. No messin around with driving all over the place. I have seen coupons and promo codes too that take off 10-20% quite frequently. anyway, there ya go!\n",
      "everyone knows uber  is fast but when you had couple of drinks at the of the night and want to go home the ride u paid $18 to get bar would cost you $54 to get back home. why? cuz demand is high. really wow there fast in everything\n",
      "For a service that asks for your credit card number right off the bat - they should really provide a support phone number. I trust you with my credit card information and all you give us is a general support email? I don't want to write you an email that gets responded to in a week when it comes to my money. People will be upset by this no matter what. _x000D_On another note, I see a lot of bad reviews on your company masked by fake good reviews on Yelp. Way to go, Uber.\n",
      "great service, but hiring drivers who do not know their way around a town and only rely on GPS is unrealistic. Sometimes they just have to know intersections and how to get places without punching it into a GPS.\n",
      "Uber has several problems that make it a poor experience for consumers IMHO based on my own experiences:1) Their drivers are not well-trained or carefully selected. As a result, some drivers don't know where they are going and are just bad drivers who would never be hired by a taxi company (which in my book is pretty bad). So your trip could take twice as long as it should, which means if you're late it's very hard to depend on Uber. 2)  It costs a lot. Some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab. They also use \"surge pricing\" which can increase the price of your fare. 3) Uber customer service has a bad attitude. Sort of like \"you're wrong, this is why we're right\". I'm not saying their customer service is worse than cab companies, but I am saying my experience with Uber customer service was poor. So in summation, Uber is a good idea, poorly executed. I'd try one of the other cab hailing apps in your city (Flywheel, Instacab, etc.) because you're likely to save money and have a better driver.\n",
      "Uber is kind of like magic. You punch a few buttons on the app on your phone, and you watch as a black car appears out of nowhere at your doorstep. It's so much better than calling a taxi it's ridiculous. It does come at a price though--the black car service I've found to be about 20-25% more than a taxi, and the Uber taxi service was maybe 10-15% more. But honestly, it's kind of worth it. It's so painless...if only every service was like this.\n",
      "Regardless of what Uber says... they could care less about driver earnings, they are just interested in signing up new drivers. Last Saturday night, in Ocean City Maryland... a coastal town which runs about 7 miles long had 11 drivers. That is one for every 2000 feet of roadway. That is nothing but total BS. About every three days I get a message from Uber offering a $350 bonus if I refer a new driver and they make 50 trips. Hey Uber... how about concentrating on the drivers you have and making your driver app work?\n",
      "Uber doesn't care for its drivers. So UBER doesn't take any fuel charges for over 2 weeks, then sends a letter explaining how it was their fault and they will correct the problem over two pay periods only take all the fuel charges from me in one pay. And on top of that, riders damage my vehicle and UBER tells me pay $1,000 deductible to file a claim. They overcharge riders on the upfront pricing and takes over 25% of nearly all rides over 2 miles. And it's not fair that driving at night subjects me to being rated by drunk racists who in turn are the deciding factors to whether I am able to continue driving on the platform.\n",
      "So I rode about a week or two ago and I had a few hour drive . Was already costing me enough and I was disrespected due to being trans and the driver stopped on the way never stopping the meter so I was charged  extra . Wrote uber and they said they can't do nothing but say sorry and have an good day . Wrote in over and over and there just like again we can't give you credit or anything have an good day_x000D_Useless and an waste of time_x000D_Never suggesting them to anyone _x000D_Worst company in the world _x000D_Wouldn't recommend them to anyone\n",
      "I purchased an Uber gift card and put $30 on the card. I have been unable to use it because every time I try to book my ride it says \"we cannot accept this form of payment.\" I have been back and forth via e-mail with Uber and have tried everything that they have told me to, but nothing is working. I have since had to pay out $47 in transportation costs because I cannot use my Uber credit. It shows up on my account but won't process. Uber has not been able to give me any solution nor have they attempted to refund my money. I don't have money to just give away, I want my $30 back. DO NOT PURCHASE AN UBER GIFT CARD, IT WILL BE A WASTE OF MONEY!!!\n",
      "Uber driver was late and stopped 50 meters ahead of where he was supposed to be. We wave him down but he doesn't come.

      "Used Uber probably about 10 times. 98% of the time they arrived almost 30 minutes late and ended up at the wrong destination. They didn't pay attention to the sign on the road showing the address nor did they have a reliable means of locating such a simple address. Absolutely ridiculous! In the last few times I used them they also added a booking fee of $2.50. Unimpressed! In speaking with the drivers, they're not from the area and don't know where they are going. Relying solely on a GPS. One driver didn't even know his bearings, N, S, E, W. That baffled me to no end. As a result of this crappy service, I've cancelled my account with them. Local cabs are only a few dollars more, arrive on time and know EXACTLY where they are going!!!\n",
      "This damn service has been charging me for rides that I haven't used!!! I just notice that on my bank statement that Uber been charging me 3 to 4 rides a week. I notify my bank and they pull over 50 rides in the past 90 days that I haven' used. I'm a OTR truck driver and have 2 cars at home!!! My next step is to report Uber to the BBB and take them to court on this crap. For now on I'll take a cab and pay the extra money instead of getting ripped off by UBER!!! PEOPLE Stop using uber!!!\n",
      "The service was really quick and professional! I liked it and I will definitely recommend it to my friends!\n",
      "My vehicle inspection ran out. Uber gave me no notice. I went and got it inspected and sent in the inspection papers to Uber. They emailed me back and said \"it was the wrong form. You have to get Uber forms to fill out.\" But I could not respond back to that email to find out how to get those. I tried for days to get in touch with Uber about the form they have that you need but you CANNOT get in touch with anyone in any way. They just reply from generalized questions on their website.\n",
      "I signed up through a Google ad directly to Uber's website for Orange County drivers in CA which will receive $700 after signing up. No conditions or terms listed. I took pics and video of it because I read so many stories about them trying to cheat people. I inquired after I signed up when I would get my bonus, they then told me it was only $250 for OC drivers. \n",
      "We have never used Uber and did not know the procedure, so a friend of ours called to confirm our 10 minute trip from her home to the airport. The ride would cost us $60. We didn't know our friend charged it on her account. Of course when we got to the airport the driver removed our luggage and held out his hand. We gave him $60 unknowingly that they are paid in advanced over the phone with a secured credit card payment. He knew darn well it must of been a mistake. No way anyone tips $60 for a 10 minute ride. He did not say anything. The driver kept the money.\n",
      "I've been driving for Uber for a while now and the Uber navigation application is a total disappointment. When you accept a rider request the address for the rider disappears from the application screen leaving you at the mercy of the Uber application which doesn't navigate very well. So you don't have time to enter it in your vehicle GPS application. Then the Uber application routes you to the wrong location and doesn't understand what direction your car is actually going I used both Google maps and Waze applications and had the same issue. The Uber application doesn't interface with either well and has you going in circles quite often. Uber will waste your time and money when you make some. Uber gets a big portion of it in fees. They should have done a better job of development. My car GPS runs circles around Uber's application and has no problems getting me to specific addresses. So what's wrong with Uber's application?\n",
      "Uber is ripping everybidy off. The charge too much for a short distance it is almost safer and faster to get a cab simce they have a stupid map that does not show the driver where should he meet the person who requested tge ride. It happneded to me several times that the driver could not find my location. Everytime the fare came as a surprise to me. Too much!!!! I used to be able to contact the driver to tell them my address and now I can not even do that.\n",
      "I booked the Uber at 636pm for railway station. The status showed that it will take 4 mins to reach the destination. The Uber driver SADIKNOOR whose car number was ** (almost right) called up and inquired where I wanted to go. I told him the destination railway station. After waiting for long and not able to see the driver, I called him up and asked how much more time it will take and where was he? He said it will take only 2 mins to reach. He was not telling the proper destination and on further inquiring, got to know that it was not 2 mins but 10-15 mins. I also got to know that the driver was moving to opposite direction. It was around 655 pm. We were very tense as there was train of 2 senior citizens and despite leaving home early, we were afraid if the oldies needed to rush and ignore the consequences of health and catch the train... Thanks Uber!\n",
      "Uber has been horrid to work for. Week after week they keep issuing me a fee for the UberEATS bag that I have already paid for. Each week it gets taken out and they still have yet to fix it. Secondly they give you \"incentives\" but then make it impossible to reach those. I should have earned an additional $40 and instead they say that somehow I didn't meet the requirements. This company is a joke!\n",
      "I confirmed a pick up for 8:55 am for an Uber. The trip for the driver to come and pick me up says he'll be at my place in 5 minutes. So 30 minutes passed and the driver never shows up so I have to cancel the pick up from Uber but before I cancel, Uber deducted to my account of $5.61 and when I cancel the pick up they credited me with $5 for the next ride. Why would I used Uber again if they screwed me up? I think it's not my fault if they did not fulfill the contract that they will be at my place in 5-9 minutes. That's why I have to cancel the trip otherwise I will stick to it.\n",
      "Well when I sign up with Uber I was looking for some extra income on the side. In the beginning it started pretty slow, but I figured some things out to make decent money using Uber. Like some of the previous reviews the money you make doesn't really cover all of your expenses like gas, car maintenance, etc. For example your total trip fee is 407.80 - Uber fee 103.21 = my actual earnings 304.59 - gas $70 = 234.59 for about 27 online hours. Which comes out to be about 8.69/hr below minimum wage. I put up with it because I needed the money. \n",
      "I picked the customer from the exactly surge area and they went to 12 miles away. So, I was in the surge area which is x3.0. But Uber gave me no surge for this trip. I messaged to Uber, they said, I was not in the surge. But I was sure. Next day, I got another request from surge place. That time, I took the screenshot which shows the request comes from surge sides but no surge appears. I send these information to Uber. Uber still says no and this was not in the surge side and asking me customer's name. I don't save customers name or any information of customers. I said like I know which trip was it and I sent the trip information I have to them. They still says what was the customer's name, trip date or whatever. They don't give my money.\n",
      "I took an Uber in the terminal to my house. The bill was 27.00. Later on I checked my credit card and I was charged with 150.00 cleaning fee!! It was me and my wife in the back seat. The driver put the luggage in the trunk. I emailed Uber immediately, and they send me a picture of a back seat full of garbage, rocks, food, etc. I explained the situation, I called my bank. Finally they apologized to me and they promised me a complete refund. Please, from now on, take a picture of the car before and after. This drivers use any kind of strategy to charge you 10 times more money. Be advised. Thanks.\n",
      "Uber for me is so buggy that I can simply not use it. I can not get my head around how a billion dollar company can not build a working app or website. _x000D_Bug (design flaw) 1: you need to request permission through support to use the mobile website as a rider._x000D_Bug 2: right now, the entire help.uber.com website is down. For hours. What?!_x000D_Bug 3: once you've been granted \"permission\" to use the mobile web-interface for rides, there is no way to change your phone number. There's an \"edit\" button for the phone number on the non-mobile website, but this then tells you to go to the app (which you can't use, that's why you're using the mobile site, durrrr)._x000D_Bug 4 (design flaw): once you've signed up with Uber there is no easy online way to delete your Uber account. I've looked into this and you actually need to contact support (the same support who's webpage is completely down right now) and write them an email saying you want your account deleted. Really?! In 2017? They're a billion dollar company but their website and software is worse than that written by a startup full of 12 year olds in their moms basement. I feel sorry for any talented coders working under Uber's obviously out of control \"manage\"ment.\n",

I had to borrow money for the next two weeks for rides and then pay them back when I get paid. Well the next day it was $9 to get to the babysitter and then $20 to get to work.

      "I have been driving with Uber for over three months. I have great reviews from passengers who I have dropped off at many locations all around Orlando. I strongly recommend that no one drives with Uber. They are complete rip off. You will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you don't even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if there's a rude passenger which Uber does not confirm who the passenger is. They will cause damage to your car and once he reported to Uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and I did no longer responsible. Any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay $1000 or more to fix your own car. They don't want to take responsibility for anything and when you sign up for Uber it clearly states that they are responsible for damages caused by passengers.\n",

Told the guy that they need to provide me with a lawyer and that they must pay for high tech cameras so I can protect myself while driving for Uber. They said that they will not do anything and following day they shut down my access and couple months later they discontinued my partnership for violating company policy.

      "Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold  when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card. I have for three weeks been trying to resolve this problem on two separate situations and the customer service is horrible. Isn't it illegal for them to keep a hold on your  money even after they get paid for the services of an Uber driver taking you to your destination. And why does it take so long for it to drop off from your checking account they should confirm you have the money then debit your account for the Uber ride and then that's it.

When we were ready to leave on New Years Day the Uber app showed because of the high demand our fare increased to 9.7 times. It was raining and there we did not see other choices (taxi's, buses, Lyft) available so I agreed to this. Our bill to go back to our hotel was over $140.00. I received an invoice from our first fare of $15.00 but I never received an invoice from the $140.00 fare. I emailed Uber about the invoice and did not receive a response. Nothing that I read in the Uber app discussed this and I feel this is completely underhanded of Uber to pull this kind of a stunt.\n",
      "My first experience with uber was absolutely horrible. A driver by the name of Wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe, comfortable and convenient way to get to our location. It was not. The car (ford focus) was in horrible shape, the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains. The vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad I could hardly breath, and the driver was very unprofessional. He didn't use GPS and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way, we accepted since there was room, but then Wylder drove around for 30+ min looking for this other potential \"client\". He finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said \"I am suppose to be looking for a girl named Brittany\"... umm, That would be me! He didn't seem to know what he was doing one bit. I felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions. With this being my first experience with uber, I was very dissatisfied and probably wont be using the services again\n",
      "I drive for uber in Orlando. My car is always clean, safe and I received a lot of great feedback from passengers. I driven all over Orlando many times very late at night only for uber to keep all my earning and display that I owe them. I've had to spend for a lot of gas and tolls, new breaks, tires, deep cleaning because of messes made by  some passengers and when I ask where are my earnings I get a bs response. It's as if I been doing favors for people driving them around all for nothing. I'm going to find out who I can talk to so I can file suit again uber\n",
      "I was driving for Uber. They said you will make it $1500.00 a week, this is true lie. Working up to 75 hours a week and my salary $500 a week. In two months my car was destroyed over 20.000 miles. That is ridiculous how uber trick people, after I spent more than $7.000 now my car is to hold. Uber is a big rip off company and I never recommend to nobody to work for uber. If you do that you will be really disappointed. Please don't waste your time.\n",
      "Driving for Uber is depressing and not satisfying. I would say 20% to 30% of people are completely irrational and have unrealistic expectations. Driving rich, hollow, and entitled people in my car is not a joy. After making a small comment to a rider about living on a hill I was asked to turn up the radio immediately. I laughed at how rude the exchange was. I picked up a lady from a BMW dealership. She told me the dealership booked her a ride. She immediately told me she was not pleased with the car, that she likes nice cars even though the car is clean 2015 Honda Civic.\n",
      "I love the convenience offered by these cabs. It has taken a while for me to catch on the trend but I'm now using Uber for most of my in town commutes. Highly recommended for every person on the move. Regards\n",
      "On app Uber lures u to money making areas but once u get there,your riding around wasting gas hoping you get a rider.  wear and tear on your vehicle....good luck with that. Uber dont care.they stress u to drive but wont help u with money to fix car._x000D_Lyft Looks Out. If u wanna drive,Lyft pays better than Uber and less bull$#*!.\n",
      "I requested an Uber ride on Thursday the 15th 2016 to take me from my home in Apopka Vineland to a Dentist Office in Dr. Phillips. The Uber arrived and took me to an address that I explained to him did not appear to be the correct address as it appeared to be that of a private home in a private neighborhood instead. I tried to explain this to the Uber driver, however, very rudely he requested assured me that that was the correct address. I got out of the vehicle to check the place out and see if it was the office, but, the Uber turned around and left me there (IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!!!!) _x000D_I contacted Uber on their contact line to tell them about their experience on repetitive occasions, however, to this day 23rd of the month no one ever did. This is quite unbelievable for me as I have been riding with Uber for a long time and dedicated; but if I ever have something like an outstanding balance with them they never play to hurry notify me for their funds. All I wanted was for someone to return my messages so I could state my case. Was that too much to ask for???\n",
      "Emailed them about an issue with Uber Pool (Driver name Tejan in Mitsubishi Lancer in DC metro area on Saturday night at 8:14pm) and was promised internal investigation  but they didn't contact me after that, shared a trip with another 3 people instead of 2, all drunk, one of them with a drink in his hand. I am a girl and was not willing to make an issue and was hoping the driver will do something but he didn't open his mouth to stop the F Words coming from the mouth of the men instead he opened the window and let us freeze in the cold because of alcohol smell. Inappropriate touching due to us crammed in the back, their girlfriend was in between but the guy with a drink kept his arms around her reaching to my shoulder. Uber customer service is a joke.\n",
      "I drive for uber since my last job ended and so far Uber has been the worst company to imagine. I always notice that most of my payments has not been complete, either they pay far much less than expected or give me less than what I actually pay for toll. Just Thursday 12/15 I picked a lady from Wellesley to Newbery Boston and it took me 24 miles and 42 mnts to get to the destination after driving 6 miles to pick up. This useless company gave me $8.04. Since then I tried contacting them but they keep giving computer-tailored message. Am planning a lawsuit against them and if you Uber driver and been cheated and feel same that this company is a fraud reach out to me.\n",
      "VERY UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE FROM UBER'S SUPPORT. On 12th December 2016, I have registered with Uber and uploaded a valid credit card. On the same day. The same day, Uber disabled my account and suspended too. There is no Phone Number listed to contact Uber Support. The only mode of correspondence is email communications. Uber support team never gave a valid reason for suspending my account. This is nothing but HARRASMENT on part of an International Company._x000D_SP U\n",
      "We ordered an Uber Select ride home from the airport (this was not the first time we rode Uber Select). While waiting for the ride, which was 7 minutes away when we ordered it, the driver cancelled for some reason. We had to reorder the ride. And we got the same driver, who did come a few minutes later. The ride home was no problem, but we got a cancellation fee of $10 that showed up on our credit card transactions. \n",
      "On Dec 4 2016 in the evening I ordered a Uber car. Address was on the corner of 16th street in front of the Union Square Cafe... Approx 7:30 pm... going to Penn Station. Two of us. We could not find the driver and I attempted to call him. He got frustrated and cursed me. He told me I was a \"** stupid person\". His name began with a G. I was mortified. How dare he talk like that. I did contact you and never received a response. I was charged $5.00 twice on my PayPal account. I want him punished and spoken to. I also expect a refund for services I did not receive. After this incident I signed up for LYFT. I will try them out.\n",
      "It's nice that Uber can help people to bring where they want to go. But I am not happy much so when they don't give back cancellation fees and trip that never take still. They charge. Some drivers are good but some they are not. Start a trip without being pick up is sucks because they will charge you no matter what. Also some drivers they don't know how to used GPS and take you a long trip which fees getting higher and change without knowing it. Hope they can fix it and return Riders Money because that is stealing on Uber Part.\n",
      "For myself Uber has been a pleasant surprise. After reading through a hundred plus reviews and watching a few YouTube related videos(hysterical). I found myself uncertain if I wanted to join the Uber Brigade. The reviews seemed for the most part, to be negative. Not enough pay, a lot of down time etc. For myself, Everytime I flip on the Uber app it's non stop, until I stop. However I live in Toronto and I only use it part time. I have a full time gig. If I work Uber its 2 to 4 hrs a night Monday to Thursday at \"rush hour\".Friday I go 5pm until 10pm and start back up at 2-2:30am and work for a few more hours. Saturday repeat and Sunday is always busy up until 4pm. The rate varies for me but I base it by the day. It's been as low as $18 an hour and as high as $35 an hr. I don't always work the best times but I'm still averaging $21 an hr. After my first month. If you work the right times you can make $25-35 an hour, for me a perfect effortless part time job. The people are great. I always offer water and candy.  Anyway if you're reading this and contemplating just check it out what do you have to lose. Here's my reference number you'll receive a minimum $50 incentive after your first 10 rides. Or at least that's what my incentive was. I believe it varies by city but anyone can use it https://partners.uber.com/join/?city=Toronto&invite_code=nqrh6fgpue\n",

      "I started driving for Uber on November 17. I took them up on their offer to rent a car through Enterprise. I have seen the charges on my account where the vehicle is being paid for/deducted out. This past weekend, Uber temporarily deactivated my account because my vehicle registration and insurance \"expired\". I resubmitted my documents several times and only received a generic response about how they were invalid. I had no recourse based on these email responses until the following Monday when the local office opened back up, which prevented me from working the whole weekend. The Greenlight Hub's response was that it's my problem that I couldn't get it fixed over the weekend. \n",
      "After my credit card info was stolen and charged via Uber, fortunately the amount was refunded. But my nightmare didnt stop there. Soon I found my Uber account was inaccessible and they replied that I need to email them the scanned copies of my government ID and credit card. I told them that would expose me to bigger risk and willing to meet their local employee if necessary. They sent me this \"I've reviewed your account. It appears that your account has been suspended for activity that violates our Terms and Conditions and will be unavailable for you to use until further notice. We will let you know if we will consider lifting the suspension.\" Do I smell some sabotage there? I violated T&C because I am trying to protect myself not sending my credit card?\n",
      "On December 10, 2016, my son used Uber for same ride he takes monthly to NYS Army National Guard located at 60-80 Lexington Avenue, New York City. I was shocked that I was charged $48.34. Normally the trip averaged between $18-30, always pooled, you can see based on trips this year: 12/10/16 - pickup on Albany Ave, Bklyn NY, drop off National Guard located 60-70 Lexington Avenue, NY. Time: pickup 4:27 am, $48.34. 11/4/16 - same pickup and drop off. Time pickup 4:29 am, $17.55. 9/10/16 - same pickup and drop off. Time pickup 4:41 am, $25.63. 7/11/16 - same pickup and drop off. Time pickup 4:42 am, $27.22. 6/8/16 - same pick up and drop off 88 Lexington Avenue. Time pickup 4:10 am, $31.13. Uber sent me a breakdown for last trip. Only thing different was the Upfront Fare Adjustment, which was now $20.90. Uber would not reimbursement me anything. So disappointed!\n",
      "This past weekend I drove for Uber at 4:00 p.m., the app was doing some weird things like trying to restart and re-log. I rebooted my phone several times and I still had the same problem. Then I received a message stating that my password and debit card was invalid. So I reverified everything and even put in my debit card again. That was when the nightmare began! I received an email confirmation that the funds were transferred from my account to my bank account. Assuming it was there (bad on my part), I spent the money, only to come home and find out that Uber did not pay my bank!!! So I messaged them several times, and they have changed their story SIX different times!!! I am very fed up with Uber right now as a driver. I loved to drive, but the customer service and how they treat their drivers when there is a payment issue is unbelievable! I need to know where I can file a complaint against them about this. \n",
      "It's a very simple matter. I've been using UberEATS to place orders for food. It has a program in place where if you refer someone you get 15 off. I had 3 invite codes so I placed an order for a pizza. The total came to 4.99 with my 15 off discount (which I have the receipt saved for it). Afterwards they went into my account and altered it without my knowledge and removed my promos after I placed the order and sent out a receipt for 19.99. I called them and they slightly hinted towards my account being altered by someone in email support but they didn't expand on that matter and acted as if they didn't see any of my invite codes. \n",
      "We travel quite a bit and used Uber always. It was so easy, fast pick up, clean cars, nice drivers, roomy cars, some had amenities like hard candy, and courteous drivers.  Right now three of us are crammed in a small car listening to the drivers personal conversation. We waited 10 minutes for him even though the app said three minutes away. Yesterday from the airport we were listening to the drivers music which was load and not appropriate for my son. It was loud and w asked her to shut if off but she just turned it down. Then I would crack my window and she kept shutting it. Is it NYC Uber or is it like this everywhere?  One more try maybe but then back to yellow cabs.\n",
      "I ordered for an Uber pool today which is the 12/08/2016. Not only did Uber give a wrong pick up location to the driver but also charged my card twice for the correct rate and incorrect rate. After waiting 10 min in the cold for the driver, I had to direct him to the right pick up location. When he picked me up, he advised he had to first pick up to people at the Marriott which was ok with me because I had ordered for Uber pool anyway. We pick up the couple and I was dropped first. \n",
      "Driver said I cancelled. He picked me up, took me to get my son from school. His truck was nasty as hell. He was overall creepy and I will not use Uber again. He took me to get money off my card to tip him. Worthless bastard.\n",
      "I was waiting in front of the pickup address on the curb, freezing. Just when the cab arrived, it suddenly left, and then a minute later I got a message saying the driver had to cancel and I should order another one. I did, two minutes after the driver canceled, which the record shows. Then I got charged five dollars for canceling! This was clearly a mistake, and I wanted to correct it. But there is NO WAY to talk to any customer support on the phone. I sent a tweet and an email, and did not get a response within 24 hours. I'm still waiting.\n",
      "I worked with UberEATS for about 2 months. I accepted 100% of requests and made deliveries as quickly and efficiently as possible. One evening, there was a $20/hour promotion. It was held from 5pm to 9pm. I logged on using their app at 4:57 pm and did not log off until 9:00 pm. I looked at the app later that evening and it said I was on for only 3 hours and 21 minutes. The next day, it said 3 hours and 30 minutes. Then, when I let the help department know that this was not correct, and clearly explained why, I was told by two separate people that I was only on for 2 hours and 48 minutes. A third person said I was on for 3 hours and 47 minutes. \n",
      "Without a doubt the worst experience of my life with Internet based services. Drivers in NYC either can't follow directions or have difficulty conversing in English.  I couldn't find a way to communicate my frustrations with Uber. The phone number posted goes to a fax machine or another digital line. I am a SF Bay Area resident and was shocked at my experience. Moving on to give Lyft a try.\n",
      "I have been driving for Uber for 3 weeks and haven't been paid a cent! They keep telling me 'we have resolved your problem' when they bloody well have not. The keep telling me my bank info is incorrect. I have checked it 12 bloody times. It is perfect. I have sent them screenshots of my bank into and screenshots of it entered into the Uber system. 100% match. Still, the can't pay me. They tell me to go to the local Uber office, which I do. They verify that my banking info is 100% correct. So, they suggest I go to my bank. I do that. The bank verifies that the info I have given Uber is 100% correct and everyone is scratching their heads because they can't understand why Uber can't pay me the hundreds of dollars they owe me. And, all I get from Uber is copied and pasted form responses. $#*! you, Uber.\n",
      "I am new to Uber. Signed up... tried to book a reservation for a ride for attending a New Year's Eve Party. Found out from a rude driver that \"that's not how Uber works.\" Now tell me what good is a service like this if your can't call and make a reservation as I described? Totally useless and bound to fail in the long term... At least I hope it does...\n",
      "I leased a car thru Uber leasing program in Tampa Honda. I was not given a choice of car and wound up with a 2015 Corolla with stains and burn holes on the seats. The dealership never sent a tag for the car despite me contacting them daily regarding my tag about to expire. They wouldn't issue a new temp tag, told me they mailed it out on 3 different dates and NY temporary tag expired. I couldn't drive the car illegally so it sat there for over a month until they repossessed it. I called the leasing company and was told over $1200 to redeem the car in 4 days. I called on 4th day and was told now it was over $1400 to redeem the car that day.\n",
      "Really worst experience with Uber cab service. Last week I booked a ride & driver started trip without picking me. Finally after some time when I called him, he told me that he can't come & it was medical emergency.\n",
      "Hi All. Just want to share my experience, I visited from pickup location to destination which was just 17 KM far but driver started the trip already that I could not check as I had full trust because it didn't happened me before. Total distance which he covered 27 KM. Friends please make sure you check pickup location correctly. I lodge case with Uber but no reply. Such cheating is going on. I could not believe it. Let me know if you know any other way to contact UBER.\n",
      "After landing at Oklahoma City airport 11/28/16 for business, I requested an uber pick up to take me to my hotel. The driver was very nice and the rate was reasonable at $20.31. I then requested an uber pick to take me from the same hotel on 12/4/16 to take me to the Oklahoma City for my return flight. When I received the charge it was $40.83.\n",
      "Recently, my Uber account was hacked. Suddenly I was driving all over Nigeria (I live in Minnesota). When I tried to address the hack, I discovered 1. Uber has no phone-based customer service, 2. Uber's email customer service is basically useless. _x000D_After visiting the Uber office nearest to me, I was given a promise that the charges would be reversed and my account would be cancelled. After 3 days, the charges were reversed, but Uber refused to cancel my account. Now, more charges are being accrued and Uber customer service is again refusing to respond personally to my complaints. Guess I will be making another trip (this will be the 3rd) to the home office closest to me. _x000D_Uber does not let you cancel your account- you must go through their customer service representatives. And when you do, they refuse to do it. I will advise every person I know to cancel their account and switch to a different ride service.\n",
      "I have used Uber pretty much since it was introduced. However, now that Uber tracks your location EVEN if your phone is OFF, i'm out. I will never use Uber again until they change this policy. Deleted it from every device in my family and am passing the word to everyone who will listen to do the same._x000D_If your a driver and want my business, switch to Lyft._x000D_Big brother is watching and his name is Uber\n",
      "Uber classified me as a low rate because of it being a four door luxury leather, fully loaded 2015 LTZ Chevrolet truck and it's white with Buckskin leather, Bose stereo system, heated air conditioned seats with Wi-Fi. And every customer that I have picked up under uberX says they did not expect this kind of ride and Uber says this truck is a low standard truck. When I email UBER over this situation they did not reply.\n",
      "My wife had a foot operation and we used Uber in Miami against my wish, but the drivers had no training ie waiting for the passenger to get downstairs from their flat._x000D_We were over charged and Uber promised but we never got the refunds._x000D_The best option is to get a licensed cab where ever you may live, if you go to London ever, Uber cars are more expensive than black cabs in the rush hours and they don't know, even with GARMIN where they are going. PS ; Uber is valued in Billions on the stock market, because they get 15% of the cost of the ride worldwide everyday.\n",
      "I have asked Uber 5 times via email for directions on creating an Uber account. It will not let us do it because it wants a mobile phone number. We are retired and have no need for a mobile phone anymore.  I need to use my house phone but it rejects it. _x000D_How can I utilize Uber services without having to purchase a mobile phone.  It does not make any sense.   Can anyone help us?\n",
      "Stealing miles and therefore money from drivers. If you complain via email they use the bots to answer the dumbest questions. If you call those folks they disconnect you after waiting for 2 or 3 minutes. Virtually impossible to resolve any issues.\n",
      "Cut driver fees want them to drive more put more wear and tear on for less ,Won't add a tipping to App . Its not worth it ,stay away people.\n",
      "Was traveling home late one night, saw an extremely drunk girl on bart. She was stumbling around and said she was going to drive home. I said I would pay for her Uber to make sure she got home safely so she didn't kill anyone, then got whacked with a $150 charge. Apparently she got sick. I understand the policy, but really? So the message is, don't be a good Samaritan. Let people drive home drunk and kill themselves and others.\n",
      "I order car, which was reportedly 6 minutes away, but did not arrive until 20 minutes later. I tracked the car on an app on my phone and the car was driving in circles. I texted the driver and told him I was across the street from a local college and I noticed the car do a u-turn and start heading in the right direction. If Uber doesn't have local drivers they need to say so. Why send a driver from NYC into the outer suburbs when they don't know where they are going! Also teach them to follow the directions on their GPS!\n",
      "Yesterday I had a ride with Uber pool. It showed \"paying 88\" from my home to work place. But after getting down at my destination driver asked me to pay 178. This is not at all fair. The driver has cancelled other pool ride who is going to share with me and asked me to pay that amount also. Uber is not at all giving satisfaction to customers by Uber pool rides. If no one shares ride with pool, that's not my mistake. Really a worst experience.\n",
      "We called an Uber cab and the driver told us it would be two minutes. The driver cancelled the ride and we got charged a 5 dollar fee and we got left with no ride. Real nice scam you guys got going. Never again will I use this service.\n",
      "We called an Uber to head to the San Jose airport as we often do. Our first driver showed up and asked us where we were going and we said San Jose airport. Immediately he said he is \"going to have to pass\" since he wants to get home soon. He didn't want to take us that far. I find this appalling - the airport is a 18 miles, 20 minute ride away. If he didn't want to accept passengers then why did he accept our ride? We wasted 8 minutes Waiting for him for nothing. _x000D_We then called another Uber and she came after 5 minutes. She also asked us where we were going and when we told her the airport she said she had to pass because she didn't have proper authorization to make trips to the airport. Needless to say we were pretty pissed at this point but decided third time's a charm. _x000D_The third driver was 5 minutes away. We called him right then and there and specifically asked him if the airport as a destination was going to be a problem. He said \"I think it's ok\". Then a couple minutes later we got a cancellation notice. That is THREE DRIVERS in a row that refused to give us a ride based on our destination. It's not like we were asking to go 100 miles away. SJC is the closest airport to the Fremont area and there was no traffic at this time of day. _x000D_We ended up using Lyft and even with a 75% prime time charge, we knew we would get reliable service and a driver that was courteous and would take is to where we needed to go. And that is exactly what happened. Our Lyft got us there swiftly and with no issues or complaining about the destination. Uber, you have LOST this customer. I find this appalling and completely unprofessional. One cancellation I can maybe understand and brush off as a specific driver issue. 3 in a row means there is something systemic going on and that your customer service model is broken. Take care of your drivers so they take care of your customers. _x000D_Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. Doesn't seem like there's enough reprimanding for drivers canceling on riders. Use Lyft or alternatives and stay away from Uber.\n",
      "I have tried to be a driver for Uber and have nothing but the run around with them. When you email them all I got was emails back from 5 to 6 different people and none of them could just answer the question I asked. They always gave me the run around. This has been going on for 2 months now. If this is how it would be if you did get to drive for them then am glad I won't be.\n",
      "They do not pay enough anymore to work for. Does not even cover costs to operate and maintain a vehicle AND make a minimum wage from. Too many short rides which = NO MONEY. $2.96 each short ride. They have implemented price cuts, and they have reinforced surges (which are your only REAL hope for making enough money to pay bills) to where it is almost impossible to get a surge fare now unless you're downtown on a Saturday night, which might I add all other drivers are there, too, giving you even more competition. \n",
      "I took my first Uber in Atlanta this weekend, and I have to say I was highly impressed! The whole ride cost $19.96, we were picked up in a very clean late-model sedan, the driver was very nice. I felt very safe while he was giving us about a 15 minute ride to a suburb of Atlanta! Same ride would've probably cost nearly $50 with a cab!!! I will take Uber whenever I can!\n",
      "I took an UBER from Pacific Heights to the SF airport and it cost $85.00!!!! That is outrageous! I was not told of the charge, as the driver picked me up at the airport, then stopped at my hotel to get my suitcase and then to the airport. The traffic was bad, but he should have told me it would be $85.00, that is crazy!!\n",
      "My son accidently left his laptop in an Uber car. He realized that just a few minutes after the Uber car already gone. He tried to contact the driver through Uber apps, however the driver was not helpful at all. The Uber management try to help but cannot force the driver to help since the driver is an independent contractor which does not have direct responsibility to the management. Characteristic of relationship between driver and management at Uber, make passenger vulnerable. Passenger cannot ask the management to be responsible of the driver behavior.\n",
      "Just wasted 90 minutes after a 49ers game waiting for Uber drivers which never showed.  For major events these folks are absolutely incompetent.\n",
      "Last night (November 18), Uber driver Dietrich in Torrance/Redondo Beach took off with my 17-year-old daughter's birthday money, gift cards, bank card, and expensive purse (~$350 total) when she briefly stepped out of the car as they stopped the ride to pick up a friend. She literally chased after the Toyota Yaris, but he wouldn't stop. She called the driver; he told her he'd come back. She waited two hours until 1 a.m. and he didn't. She contacted Uber support, who contacted the driver, who of course denies anything was in the car.\n",
      "EXTREMELY disappointed with Uber. 5 days ago my account with Uber was hacked and someone in Australia (I am a US resident and have never even traveled there) charged my card upwards of $100. I had to cancel my credit card and am currently moneyless as I am away at school with no bank nearby. I have contacted Uber FIVE times and NO RESPONSE whatsoever. I cannot cancel my account as Uber does not allow customers to call a support line, forcing me to communicate via messages through my account. Ironically, none of my messages have been answered and someone is still attempting to use my account. The company does not allow you to remove credit card information from your account unless you add in another. I will never use Uber again and I recommend you do not either. If something goes wrong you will have no help whatsoever from this unprofessional company.\n",
      "Oct 20th ride from Milwaukee Airport to downtown which normally takes 15 minutes and did take that time again. Driver wrote down 25 minutes and charged me $61.00. It was my first and last ride with Uber. Driver lied and scammed me. You cannot get Uber by phone and neither can my credit card company. Their help does not work well and I got no answer. You can't get in touch with this bad business.\n",
      "I just signed up to Uber and cannot use the app. I have downloaded it 3 times, it still does not work, so what do I do now? I want to use it in 2 days and also in London next year. The reviews I have read so far seem daunting, have I done the right thing?\n",
      "For two weeks in a row while traveling for work in DFW the drivers have constantly refused to come get me because I'm outside the \"gate\". I take the bus to remote south to avoid the airport gouge price and have the city bus as a back up option. It should not matter where I am on the airport property as long as there is public access I should be able to get a ride to my destination. Especially since you have to pay money just to request a ride! I will not be using Uber again after these two horrible weeks.\n",
      "I was run off the road yesterday by a car with the Uber sign in the window. Make sure this guy isn't your ride Licenses number 7JXD538. It happened at Powell st. and 580 at 10:37 in the morning. He then even gave me the finger! The guy in the back seat looked quite nervous.\n",
      "When I first began operating as legal public utility transportation company serving my island community here in Hawaii, I was desperate for new business and Uber could not find an actual insured, state or county LICENSED transportation company to serve our airport. After being heavily recruited to put my BMW's in their Black-Select service at the airport with assured decent compensation, I took them up on their offer with one perspective - if they have customers that are ready NOW who will pay their fares, I would have been a fool not to be the only Uber available at a popular airport serving the wealthiest travelers in the US... & be doing it legally in the eyes of state and county governmental as an INSURED AND LICENSED PUC operator.\n",
      "Uber does not provide live customer support. Email customer support does not work. As a rider, there is no way to contact uber for anything.  It's like a dark hole !_x000D_From a rider experience point of view, could be much better.\n",
      "Uber increases their prices 30 times when they know people are in need (i.e., leaving events, concerts). Very very unfair and unreasonable, causing people to find other alternatives taxis and shuttles, trains costing $100. Unbelievable.\n",
      "calculating in typical expenses of $.55/mile, Profit 0. Then you have to pay your own self employment \"taxes.\"     true income -15%!!!!!!_x000D_today I kept completely busy for 2 hours. As soon as trip done with one, another came. Rush hour Tuesday 330-530 was the time I actually had my Uber turned on.    took 40 minutes to get home.  milage was 50 miles.  Recall that you cannot choose where you will go to. Gross income from Uber: 26 dollars. So before expenses, 13/hr.\n",
      "INSTALLS \"PLATEPASS' ON AUTOS AND STATES THAT IT WOULD GET DRIVERS THROUGH FASTTRACK AND TOLL BRIDGES ONLY TO RECIEVE VIOLATION TICKETS LATER FOR USING \"PLATEPASS\". UBER REFUSES TO HAVE RIDERS PAY AND BLAMES DRIVERS FOR USING UBERS \"PLATEPASS\"\n",
      "I have found since using Uber it has been fantastic. But of recent weeks I can no longer get a Uber in Armadale Perth Western Australia, just keeps saying \"no drivers available, try again later.\" This happens anytime now so have had to go back to calling Swan Taxi's which I would prefer not to but have no choice as am older and do not drive, so quite disappointing.\n",
      "You implemented Google SSO in your app but you left it bare on your website? Why? What kind of classless PMs do you employ who bask in the kinks of a broken space-time continuum?_x000D_Their taxi service however is unparalleled.\n",
      "I have been driving for Uber for four months now. This past Halloween weekend, which is also a very busy football weekend in the area where I live and drive, I drove expecting and knowing that there would be surge pricing. We have some 1000+ college students coming into town for the FL/GA football game. I picked up three different groups of riders from the surging area (it was surging for two solid hours - that is how busy we were). When I got home after these trips I noticed that the fares were not close to what the surge pricing would make them. I immediately emailed customer service about each one of the trips, because you cannot do them but one at a time. I could not get them to understand that the surge pricing was not showing up like it showed on the map.\n",
      "On Oct. 7, 2016 we needed a ride to the airport so we called Uber. We needed a XL truck. Randy came in a Lincoln Navigator. Soon as the meter started he said \"I need gas.\" Now mind you the meter already started. We get to the gas station. He decides to stop the meter and cancel the trip. At $9.98, you won't get charged. He said \"But we're 1/2 a mile from our starting point.\" So, he ends the trip, gives himself 5 stars. So we start over. He says he'll fix it. Instead of getting on the freeway he drives down Gratiot. I'm like \"what's wrong with the freeway.\" He replied \"Uber is saying this is the way to the freeway.\" Okay, traffic is light, it might cut off 5 mins. Then when we get by the freeway entrance he makes a wrong turn. I'm from Detroit and know how to get around.\n",
      "Have Used  Uber several time to go to my daughters house, always charged  about $25.00, on October 31, after getting and estimate of $21-$25, I was charged  almost $50.00 each way! Double what it cost several times. 20 minute ride each way,no traffic. Can't call,all you can do is email! They keep replying they need more information, keep giving a detail description which was emails lasting almost an hour to write and still nothing! If you live in the Ny/Nj area contact ( Better get Verrcaro) channel 4, maybe they could do a story on this problem!\n",
      "Repayment of money taken from my account. On the 18 of Oct. 4 withdrawals were made on my account for a service that I did not order. This was clearly a fraud committed. Uber had given me the runaround ever since. I have sent them copies of the statements to show this. They keep saying that my email address does not correspond with the account or the email address initially used. How can it? I did not order the service.\n",
      "In many occasions almost daily bases Uber has underpay. Misentered time and mileage. Of course I have done my best to adjust the correct payment or close to compromising amount, but costing me spending long times to get corrections. This has become a common practice by Uber. I wonder if all drivers have such time or knowledge to claim their fair amount. Repetition of this practice is so often that I would like the authorities look into the matter to protect the drivers who don't realize or have no means.\n",
      "On 22 Sept I took Uber from the Orlando Airport to Kissimmee for a cost of $90.57. On 25 Sept I took Mears Transportation on return to the airport and was charged $62.00. If Uber is supposed to be cost effective but their rate is almost $30 more than a licensed transportation company then what is the purpose of allowing them to operate in metropolitan areas? I was charged a base fare, a distance fare, time fare, 2 tolls and an airport surcharge. I checked the receipt I received from Mears to compare costs but found nothing comparable. Furthermore, I looked for ways to contact Uber but the only avenue I found was Facebook and my issue was ignored.\n",
      "Asked for Uber. Was suppose to arrive in 2 minutes. Nine minutes later driver was not there. He called to say he was lost because Uber had sent him 3 different addresses for me - none of which were my pick up address! I cancelled the ride. Driver was lost and I was late waiting!! Uber confirmed cancellation, nonetheless, charged me $5.00 for cancelling because 9 minutes had passed! WHAT A RIP OFF!! And now they are trying to introduce flying cars!! It appears ripping off ON THE GROUND is not satisfying the thievery urges of the CEO! I asked Uber for a refund. They gave me two emails they couldn't do anything because they had no history of such ride request AT ALL! MY OH MY. IF YOU HAVE NO HISTORY WHY AM I CHARGED $5.00! Nothing at Uber works correctly. Their entire system is messed up.\n",
      "While on a trip tried to use uber without success. There were 5 of us so we needed (according to the website XL or SUV would work) so I selected one in our area and it gave me their phone number.  I called to make sure they would be able to accomodate all of us and the driver said no so i ended up calling the local cab company. Wasted time researching and frustration due to the fact i cant remove my credit card information now! Once its entered you can add more however there is no way to remove it and apparently no customer service!?!\n",
      "I have a PSA...Uber doesn't care. This is not shade or shame. My Uber account was hacked earlier this week by someone in Australia...yes \"the down under\". I like to travel but have never been to Australia. I tried contacting Uber via email through their website...they don't have a phone number to contact??? I sent 6 emails reporting the activity and asking for someone to contact me. I included screen shots of the receipts of the fraudulent trips that were taken under my account and to deactivate my account. \n",
      "I scheduled a ride three weeks in advance so that I could get home due to being at college and not having a car. It told me that my ride was scheduled and that it would be here within my fifteen minute window. A car never showed up!!! This service sucks. I will never use Uber again.\n",
      "I take Uber to work at least 4 times a week - yesterday I get a driver, Steven, who was a complete ** and claimed he didn't know the Philly and was at the mercy of his GPS. As shown by the map, he clearly is a dishonest driver and a danger to passengers and other drivers. After such a horrible experience and not to mention being late for work, I will never take Uber again.\n",
      "First, I would like to explain that I have NEVER nor will I now EVER have an Uber Driving Company. I received numerous fraudulent charges from the company. I tried to contact them via the phone number attached to the charge from my bank as well as via email. The phone number told me to send an email (because the phone messages get distorted or some BS) to support@uber.com...so I sent the email, and almost immediately I received a response that the email had NOT been received to go to the website and search for a response to my question...well without an acct, I cannot contact anyone. So as far as I am concerned, with the lack of their ability to have communication with their company or customer service, I think they are as fraudulent and crooked as the \"driver\" who STOLE hundreds of dollars from my account!\n",
      "We took Uber from Coral Springs to Fort Lauderdale airport. As we passed the security we realized that we left one item (painting rolled-up) in backseat. We contacted Uber right away through the app and had to wait 20 more minutes for Uber to put us with the driver on phone. He did not speak any English so we got a fellow passenger to talk to him. He said he can come in 10 minutes and meet us where he dropped us. But we were boarding and did not have enough time. At that point he gave us his phone no. and we told him we will call him in 4 days when we get back. \n",
      "Unfair payouts to drivers. On October 23/16 I have a payout for $2.72 in South Florida. I went to Uber fare estimating feature and I enter the exact route and it estimated it for $5-6 UberX. Really? You guys are ripping me off.\n",
      "An Uber driver ran over my mailbox... Ok stuff happens. But then he drove away after he untangled his bumper from the wreckage! We contacted Uber because this is considered a hit and run and the driver will be arrested. No response. It's been three days and the police are baffled by Uber's customer service... Only cryptic emails. Uber should be sued for their lack of response when dangerous people drive for them and they don't react.\n",
      "Doesn't matter if you agree to price surge. You are forced to agree when you have no other means of transportation and need to get home. Uber needs competition and when they get it, I will never use them again. They won't be able to surge as high then, and it won't matter if they are the cheapest. You earn my customer loyalty when you charge me fair prices even though you don't have competition. Under a mile and $28.95. ** you.\n",
      "I have recently been using uber in Panama central America it has turned into a nightmare experience not only with drivers but also with Uber Support personal.  one driver charged me 10 dollars for  a fare that has been costing me  only 3dollars I made a complaint and instead of supporting me they blocked me from something the driver said about me. He was not the person on the profile also and obviously just a friend of the taxi Uber Driver.  I found the app malfunctioned so many times that it caused distress to me. The drivers were so rude that they never answered calls or texts.  One taxi driver went to wrong place and did not respond to me I waited for an hour for an arrival but he never turned up.  The Uber Support personal are also rude and don't listen to your complaint properly I was actually blocked from using uber because of a driver telling lies about me.  I have never been treated so awfully by a taxi service in my entire life.\n",
      "I started driving for Uber when I saw an ad on my phone claiming that I can make up to $35/hour. I drove for a total of about 30 trips. I came nowhere near making $35/hour. The fact is, after my expenses, I made as little as.15 cents per mile, equaling my guess of less than $4/hour. After around 60 days, I received a notice that I had to pay for a car inspection. This is when I decided to stop driving for Uber. So I have two complaints: The first is that Uber is falsely advertising the pay rate for their drivers. How can they keep getting away with this? Second, when I informed them that I would no longer drive for them, they blocked me as a rider. Childish and petty are the words I would use to describe Uber's business practices.\n",
      "Been trying to start for weeks now. I'm trying to do this on the side. I know I'm not going to get a lot of money out of it. Their support is a joke, like somebody mentioned. I uploaded all of my paperwork. It was not going through and I had to contact them. After weeks of standard replies they finally sorted it out. Now I had to go through a background check. There is no way you can do that through your account profile. I waited on them to send me a link so I can do it. I finally did it. I received an approval and I was ready to go. I was given a $50 towards my first ride if I do it by midnight the same day. Got home ready to go only to find out my account was suspended for some reason. I go through my email to find out that they did a second background check for some reason and listed me in San Francisco even though I live and have all my paperwork from IL. \n",
      "DO NOT BUY UBER GIFT CARDS!! I purchase a $50 gift card and my account won't accept the promo code! I will push this issue because all UBER did was text me the same instructions which are on the back of my \"WORTHLESS\" gift card! Customer service is non-existent! The new gift card \"rip-off\" rollout was late September and apparently there are issues but don't expect UBER to help! My recourse? I didn't pay cash but now the \"hoop-jumping\" begins between GameStop (where I purchased the card), UBER (no one to talk to) and my credit card company!\n",
      "Uber is about the worse company for customer service. You can only deal with emails back and forth until you give up. This practice should be illegal. They should be required to have an active customer service line where people can call to have their problems resolved. For one their surcharge pricing is nothing short of price gouging. My daughter has had to pay $31 for an $8 fare. Also on a different trip when my other daughter left her bag in a car, the driver never got back to us and Uber just kept emailing contact the driver. It was ridiculous.\n",
      "I was waiting for a taxi at my hotel when I was approached by an Uber driver telling me he would give me a $20 cash flat rate to where I needed to go. I declined, as I had no idea who this idiot was. He then got angry with me and started yelling at me asking if I was that much of an idiot that I would spend my money on a taxi. I have never been spoken to that way by a taxi driver. Also, a registered sex offender down the street from my house, drives for Uber. You never know who you're going to get. No thank you. I'll continue to use the same taxi service that I've used for years. A child molester will not be driving my children. HELL NO!\n",
      "I strongly discourage everyone from using Uber. It's only worked 1 out of the mere 3 times that I tried using it, which is plenty enough for me to steer clear for life. The other 2 occasions were a complete nightmare; the second time I tried it, I was informed that my ride would arrive to my work place in 6 minutes, but then it changed to 12 minutes then finally 32 minutes. Eventually I was waiting for an hour and a half and finally gave up. I'm sure that if I had waited longer it never would have arrived. Yet, I must mention that while watching the map on my iPhone to see when the driver was close, I specifically saw another Uber driver no more than a mile or 2 away and they just kept going. \n",
      "Uber has terrible customer service. They have tried to automate their support to a point where the human component has been removed. Anyways today I have an actual issue. I took a ride that was quoted $5 and when I was charged $5 for. I received an email from Uber saying they updated the fare to $20. The explanation was the driver had a problem with the timing? It was a 4 minute ride. I can't even reach anyone at Uber and no one will get back to me. This is a terrible terrible company. Use the alternatives.\n",
      "I am woman Uber driver for 1 month and half, though Uber provide both way rating and feedback from driver and rider, but Uber only listen to rider almost ignore driver's feedback. Like today, I picked up a drunk passenger, he was yelling at me when I drove in the highway due to my driver app gps use different route with his app. He was yelling at me and used very bad language on me, I don't feel safe when he is in my car. I have to stop the trip, he threatened me he will let Uber give me $0 pay for trip and he will get free ride, so now, within a few hours, I got $0 pay for that trip and my rating dropped 3 points. I email Uber about the bad experience I got no reply so far. I suspect Uber listen to the feedback from driver side. Uber only care about rider and how much money they make. They provide no protection for woman driver.\n",
      "Uber charges me twice every time I request it, it charges me immediately after the end of the trip and it deducts money from my account again a few days later. I've lost so much money because of this and I'm not happy at all.\n",
      "I have been charged multiple times now for rides I have not taken.  And every time I try to resolve the issue I'm never able to get a hold of anybody and nobody contacts me back. It is more of a scam then a service\n",
      "too many issues signing up - had to email someone twice because no clear understanding of issue.  then after I got that fixed, ran into another problem - says use the app if you have problems completing information on this web page.  had the app before but it didn't function properly.  yuck.\n",
      "Now ive got you!!!! Recently I was billed Â£27 for a  Â£14 quote and you told me I agreed to the price surge even though I was sure I didn't! Tonight I booked a cab in Manchester with a Â£12-14 quote and he was 8 minutes away, when he was 2 minutes away the quite suddenly became subject to a x 1.7 surge price and had I not seen it and got in the cab I would have been charged accordingly! There is NO WAY this is legal altering a quote last minute as you did last time to tell me I was wrong! I have 2 witnesses before you dare argue!! This is a con it will be posted on Facebook and I WILL be contacting trading standards! If a price surge is in effect it has to be applied at the time of booking not surreptitiously afterwards!!!!! Disgusting practice!\n",
      "I use UBER  frequently but this last time I was accused by a White driver that her property was stolen from her car. UBER contacted me to tell me my account had been canceled. I tried to contact UBER but they never replied back.\n",
      "Former Uber partner drivers review. Worst experience driven with Uber. I never ever suggest to anybody to drive with Uber. They're more depends on Rating System. If your rating goes down, you will be fired and you will be behind the Bills. They don't care. Uber made the system in favour of the customers not the drivers who providing the safe ride in frustrating situation. Moreover Uber making the money not the drivers. If you calculate the earnings you made, you will be on minimum wage. So my advice to every newcomer: don't finance the car to join Uber. Better than do something else. Don't go to Uber. My zero star to Uber.\n",
      "Uber ripped me off! Applied \"surge charge\" of 2.2x the fare but there was no prior notification of this in the app. I was not informed and did not grant permission for this. The app only showed a fare estimate of Â£7-9. I got home to find that a taxi journey that ALWAYS costs me around Â£7-9 had cost Â£22.50, already charged to my card and I had no means of recourse in the app. I had to go onto their website to file a \"report a serious issue with you driver\" case to get to a human and they didn't read anything of what I had written - just robotic copy and paste answers! I threatened to take it further and finally got the surge charge refunded but they said it would be a one-time gesture only, so this could happen again and I'd simply be screwed. They made out that they were doing me a massive favour and I was just lying about not being notified of the surge fare._x000D_The next day (today), bizarrely I got an email through: \"Hi xxxx, To ensure your security, we have reset your password. To log into Uber, you will need to choose a new password.\"_x000D_Then when I try to reset this I get the following: \"SOMETHING WENT WRONG. There has been an error, and we are currently looking into it.\"_x000D_However others can log into their accounts using this same computer/same IP. I then checked the app and it was not accessible to me either, so they have killed my account it seems because I demanded my money back. It's fine by me because there wasn't going to be a next time anyway, but what a crooked, horrible company! Avoid!\n",
      "I've only been driving with UBER for a couple of weeks in my spare time. So far my experiences with the riders has been great, but UBER now claims that my customer rating are low 4.6% and that I have only picked up 94% of the fares offered, which is NOT True. I've accepted every single fare that popped up on my phone. And you, as a driver, have no way to look at your actual customer ratings yourself. So now, it seems that I've been suspended until I pay to take a 3 hour online course!\n",
      "My friends and I (4 females) were leaving Oracle Arena in Oakland California after a concert to go back to our hotel. We waited 1 hour and watched him pass us and several times before he actually stopped. We got on the freeway and rode for about 5 mins and he said we cancelled the ride. We hadn't cancelled at all. He pulled off the freeway under a dark bridge surrounded by abandoned buildings and said \"get out\" because he wasn't insured. It was about 1 AM. We begged and pleaded to take us to a place populated with lights and offered to pay cash.\n",
      "After giving 1000 rides for Uber I was deactivated (fired) for low ratings (which is 4.6). I was told to take a on-line course which I had to pay for to be re-instated. Forget that. Uber thinks that all their riders are sober, sane, and kind people. Well they're NOT! I put up with so much nonsense for a $4 ride I should write a book. Uber never talks to a driver. If a driver has a problem it's ** outta luck time. Uber hides behind a computer and never communicates directly with any driver. They take whatever a riders says at face value, no questions asked. I think there should be a class action lawsuit for firing without cause. How could a company hire and fire hundreds of employees a week? Pay averages out to $12 to $15 dollars an hour. You pay gas and maintenance on your vehicle and car washes are not cheap. Riders, what do you want? Because a safe ride from point A to point B is all you're paying for.\n",
      "When I arrived at Spokane, WA. I was highly recommended to utilize uber. When I scheduled my appointment via their app, the price was quoted anywhere from $11-$15. When you use their app you don't know what you are being charged until 5 mins after you leave the car when I got the shock of my life $53.46 to travel 15 mins. Way, way more than a cab. I was told I was charged $41 surcharge and that I was supposed to have been informed of this. So upset with uber, that I have vowed to never use them ever again and will tell all my friends, co-workers etc. of my upsetting experience! To add, I had to tell the driver to cut off the meter and get my own bags out of the trunk! Absolutely unacceptable!\n",
      "I used Uber for the first time on Saturday morning - 24.09.16. After my friend booked me a taxi via her phone. I had never heard of the company before, as I don't use many taxis. I wasn't aware at the time of booking - payment is taken. The taxi driver asked how much I had been quoted online as I was leaving Didsbury, Manchester to Prestwich. The taxi meter was set at Ã‚Â£3.75 and he stated the journey was approx 20 miles. I felt confused at the time as the driver appeared to be questioning how I was going to pay. I informed him I didn't have money and therefore he would have to stop at an atm. He took me the longest way home and I was charged nearly Ã‚Â£54 for the journey!\n",
      "Uber's customer accounts has been hacked and they are not reporting it to their customers. This will show up when you start getting unexpected charges on the credit card you listed on your account. You may get a receipt in your email for a trip or even Uber Eats in another state where you haven't traveled. On Uber Eats they can actually order food and have it delivered, and the total bill will be charged to your credit card. We had 2 for over $80. Since Uber has no efficient way to contact their Customer Support you may have to get creative to get their attention by sending messages through their Help system. If you are an Uber user you should consider changing your password immediately and possibly closing your account altogether. Of course you can't just do this simply and easily. Again you have to find a way to send them a message.\n",
      "I love Uber and it has it made it really convenient to get around.  My only issue is their receipts are like 4 pages long.  It is not necessary.  I travel for business and we need to expense these.  Can't they make them one page please!?!?!?\n",
      "Today I took an UberX from where I live to the Port of Boston. After the ride back, I noticed that the ride back cost me nearly $8.00 and that I was charged $22.00 for the way in and then another $11.00 because the driver indicated we were a group of 5. I asked a revision from Uber and they just ignored my request. After another e-mail they continued ignoring my request and indicated they had solved my problem! I'm now trying Lyft. Shame on you Uber!\n",
      "I left my cell phone in an Uber and I was unable to contact the driver because of it. Uber customer was terrible and kept telling to call the driver. Eventually, I changed the phone number associated with my Uber account so I could log in and call the driver but there was no phone number or option to call him... The APP told me to input the number. I explained this to customer service and they responded, \"Sorry you lost something, the best thing to do is to call your driver.\" REALLY? Same answer 3 times.\n",
      "We were in Florida for the past week.  We don't drink and drive so we used Uber on any evening we were going out.  Half of the drivers (men) were wonderful.  Knew their way around, friendly, awesome people.  The other half (women) didn't know where they were, didn't speak English, depended on me for directions, charged me extra because they got lost several times.  This is not a sexist comment for I am a woman!  We are not sure we will continue to use Uber.  The cost is less than a taxi but the frustration isn't worth it.  Uber needs to make sure whomever they hire actually knows the area where they are working!  Awful when you've been out having a good time, and then have to do your own work to get back to your hotel.  Stupid freaking drivers.  don't drive it you don't know where you are - common sense!\n",
      "I am shaking as I write this post. I had to pull over to gather my thoughts. As I was driving west on century just outside the airport an Uber driver (black Prius, I believe-or something similar) turned right on to century directly in front of me and another car. We both slammed on our breaks and swerved to the left to avoid an accident. As he approached my right side, he rolled down his window and gave me the middle finger while yelling at the top of his lungs saying \"** YOU, go back to your country.\" I'm sorry, I was born and raised in LA. I have white skin with blue eyes. My son has blonde curly hair. Do we stand out as foreigners? Even if we did, would that be a bad thing?\n",
      "I heard some great things about Uber and when a friend recommended using it, I seen no reason not to give it a try. The trip by cab would have been approximately 50.00 but I was quoted between 26-30 by Uber, so I asked for one. It was a 14.5 mile trip, one way. While waiting, a message came up asking if I wanted to use surge x4. I had no idea what this meant. There was no one to ask and it flashed up so quickly that I just said yes. \n",
      "On 9/4/2016 I dropped off a rental truck in Arizona at an open well lit location. I requested an Uber ride and within 3 minutes he drove past me and then cancelled the ride. I then requested another car which just drove past me. I finally had to walk to a convenience store after my phone died and call a real taxi who promptly showed up and took me home. I complained to Uber about each driver and only after 3 emails (for each driver) did my complaint actually get read. So I deleted the app and will not use these losers again. They did give me a worthless $40 credit, I mean a credit for a car service that leaves you hanging has no value. Why am I so mad? I am handicapped and walk with a cane. Should have just called a real cab to begin with.\n",
      "I have a free ride at Uber and wanted to avail it for the first time... The stupid driver cancelled the ride when I was already in it... It was only then when he checked my destination and began to cancel. It was irritating because I'm on a rush. The other thing is he consumed my free and charged the ride I didn't take! I saw my 200P worth of free ride was gone on my Uber account. And the Liar put a 100 consumption on the cancelled trip. He indicated I have used it! What a liar!\n",
      "Was trying to sign up as a driver. Started filling forms on website. At one point, when I gave up address, phone, email, a very next page broke and ask for a background check consent form. I have no objection to give this consent, but WHERE is this form? When I clicked \"Take a photo of your consent\" a message said something like \"Uber sent a copy of the form to you...\" Never did.\n",
      "When I retired I applied to Uber as a delivery person (just starting in my area) and a driver. Many emails later from many different people, they said they did not choose to partner with me due to my 'background' report... which I have a copy of that says \"no issues\". Suffice it to say I have been a good citizen for many many years - no marks on my license, no crazy behaviors that would get me in any trouble. I raised two nice kids and am a grandparent. Could it be my age?? No matter, I'm driving for Lyft and had zero issues at all signing up with them or driving with them... Uber will ultimately fail and I can't wait to see it.\n",
      "Driver on the app was driving around in circles for 25 minutes... while I was calling him and text him once with the name of the place to pick up so he'd know what to look for. No answer from the text or multiple phone calls. When you try to contact Uber, it's no point. The website has no contact info for the company. Will NEVER use Uber. This is unacceptable!!!\n",
      "I would never recommend it to anyone. I had a very bad experience with Uber leasing and I will not suggest anyone to go for it. I thought it's a very good idea to lease it from them. I applied, I got approved, and once again I gave a thought for couple of days to take it or not. Meanwhile I was getting email and text messages from Uber, \"You have a week left. After that you don't get it you need to reapply.\" After my days expired I went and asked, and they said, \"We can give it for you,\" and they were so nice while giving the car. They took 250 nonrefundable deposit from me and after 2 days gave me the car.\n",

      "Really Disgusting! This is the condition of National Capital Region, the biggest frustration people facing here is conveyance and moreover traffic. Nobody is hell bothered about 9-10 hours of jobs extending to 12, 13, 14, 15 hours and so on. _x000D_A person going to office or market thinks to book Uber/ Ola, the first question the driver asks is DROP KAHA KA HAI- i.e. Where is your drop location. Whereas, its clearly mentioned in Ubers rule book that the driver is not suppose to ask the drop location, not a big deal the rules are as fake as the company is. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, either the driver switches his mobile off, or standing at one position he will say that I am not able to track your location or even he will just sit over it and cancel the trip after 15 min with no intimation. This is not something that happens once or twice a week, this is something that happens twice/ thrice a day. Then for all the cancelled trips they will deduct 80/- (per trip), now if a person doesnt have the time to write them the incidence happened, they will not even return the money back._x000D_Even after my last complain to uber, I attached the screenshots and sent them, these people apologized and gave me vouchers to close the matter and said that this will not happen again. But what next, everytime I should write them such detailed mail so that they pay attention to this, they dont even have a customer care. Moreover the driver has the guts to say that JAO KAR DO COMPLAIN or Okay, Jisse kehna hai kaho. Because what worst, just that they will not get the days incentives, nothing more then that. Everybody is just into money printing business, and who is the sufferer, just the common man._x000D_Frustrated person, at last when goes to an auto wala so either he will be on strike or he asks for money as per his choice, because there are no rules. Nobody is there to check. Why is the common man working so much, just to get frustrated and depressed, for he is helpless for so many things and at last he should be happy that he has money to get admitted in a branded hospital. Anybody in India can strike for any non sense thing demanded, what should a common man do. Leave all his work and strike for the thousand things that he has to face because of wrong people into business.

First of all I rarely ever drink and I do not drink and drive and I take my job with Uber seriously. 95% of my rides on the weekend are riders who are drunk and my car can still smell like it when they get out. I let Uber know this and that I was completely offended from their accusatory email they sent me. It isn't right how Uber automatically believes the rider and they treat their drivers like crap. This is completely false and a lie and as of right now I can't drive. I have never been in an accident and I also never had an interaction with the police for being under the influence. I am so mad right now. I do not like how Uber treated me. Is there anything else I can do?\n",

      "I've been a uber driver since last year, and I just had worst experience ever. They had put an hourly incentive from 8/19 Friday up to 8/21, 10:00 pm to 12:00 mn for $20 per hour, and 12:00 am to 2:00 am for $22 per hour. They had a link once you click opt in, there's nothing you need to do to have that hourly guarantee. So I tried it and made sure I covered that time now the night of the 8/20. Guess what? They didn't pay me for the difference, they only paid $52.95 which supposed to be minimum of $84, plus what I made before 10:00 pm. They keep on saying I didn't know there was an hourly guarantee which is bunch of **!!! Told them to fix and they never paid me. Watch out drivers! I didn't sleep until 2 am just to get this guarantee only finding out they won't pay me. Whoever is doing uber, quit and join Lyft hopefully is better. If we can get together and boycott uber!!!! We're working hard with our car, gas, mileage for what? For a $3.20 trip? You spend more than what you should earning.\n",
      "I been driving for Uber only part time, pick up people on the way home or from work... To do this full time you have to be silly... if you calculate correctly it's not worth... I am usually lucky and transport respectful people but it still happens that crooks get in between. I had this young girl that everything matched name, destination she even confirmed she works at the place. Day later I see I made Zero $$ for that trip. Of course UBER did not inform me about any problem. Maybe hoping that I will overlook it. Turned out the girl just pretended she never took the ride... and what can you do? As other people state here, UBER will not protect you both side on as passenger or driver. Is the philosophy of the UBER CEO if someone read about him he will understand. Would be nice if the Gov would step in on corporations and monitor those better for consumer protection. Otherwise corporations will do whatever they want...\n",

      "Monday evening 08-22-16; Myself, My Husband, Sister and Brother in-law contacted Uber via the mobile App. Upon doing so we were quoted a $80 ride, with possible surge increase. However the app did not in detail describe or calculate the total. So I agreed with ignorance assuming that it could not be more than a few extra bucks. Later informed by Uber that their Uber drivers were in \"High Demand\", however that isn't something I would know so I cannot say why the surge was even there? I don't travel to the city often or for that matter do so during large events. Upon traveling from N. Clark to the western suburb of Lombard, IL. Not only did our Uber driver Victor take a longer route than what we suggested, he then charged us a whopping $300.27 for the ride. That's a 3.9% increase against the normal rate. I cannot say how that is even feasible, how that is even logical or where they could calculate such an amount. \n",
      "When I saw an ad online for the soon to be Uber delivery service, I was intrigued enough to sign up. What I did not know is it would take TWO DAYS to sign up! I started at home taking pictures of the documents they wanted and sending them. Four hours later pulling in for coffee, the first text started for me to resend the pictures. Then hours later at my volunteer job, I was doing it again. Even when I got home, this continued into the night, with emails as well. Just how many times do you need to send the requested pictures until your account goes from pending to activated? It's not that I don't have patience, it's just multiple communication can become irritating and annoying. It took THREE DAYS  (after angry communication from me to them to please STOP!) to find out it was multiple computer generated messages. Have patience if you want to try and sign up with Uber.

Yet, after a month, I am still not approved and still have the same issue with my insurance. On the last chat, I was on hold for about 7 minutes, while the agent corrected my problem.

I came out after literally one minute 30 seconds and his ass was gone. Like who does that??

We were forgiving, as we were just happy to have a ride until we got a receipt for $170 due to the surge pricing! We were of course shocked since the ride to the venue cost $36.

I mean this was my fourth trip with uber and I was happy because 2 times I went to the airport for a charge of 53 us and the third trip was to NRG stadium for 41 US. So I thought it will be similar because publicity always said that they charge per mile. I am new with this application and now I have a charge of 560 Usd for a 36 minutes trip. This is crazy. I am calling customer service so they can explain me how this works but they haven't answer me, so I call my bank so they can open an investigation to check if this can be legal. This can't be right, so be careful with uber, don't trust them and don't get in the car unless you are sure how much they will charge you (Sorry about my English).\n",

I looked it up on the web and it's suppose to be a new luxury vehicle. No authorization from me, not selected by my teenage granddaughter and she was sent a small older UberX vehicle and I was charged 3 times the amount. One trip was $95 to go 20 miles.

I honestly thought this was saying a percentage more as for example 8.2 percent of the trip, say a few extra bucks. Worst case scenario my husband's ride will probably cost around 50 dollars.\n",
      "Wasn't aware of their \"SURGE\" pricing, otherwise known as PRICE GOUGING. It seems if you request a ride when they're busy, you are charge more (a lot more!). I was charged 18.35 for 3/4 of a mile ride under 5 minutes. Driver said Uber does not share the inflated price with them.\n",
      "my husband was at a concert at the NRG stadium in Houston on 8/5/16 at concert end during the \"surg\" time couldn't get his app to work.  He called me when I was sleeping, sick, and groggy and saw the 8.2 percent surge charge but thought like a tip 15 percent of the total like a tip amount.  I was so upset when I saw 341.00 for the total this am!!!!!This is wrong and law suit worthy.  They need to make it very clear for the tired and apparently not bright to make a person realize that they will be stolen from a ludicrous amount.  I am going to file a complaint with the better business bureau and refuse to ever use them again. And they don't make it easy at all to complain on there site.  Please don't use them try lift or others even a taxi would have been less expensive!\n",
      "requested for uber at 09:30am to reach office, it showed waiting of 8 minutes. Waited for ueber till 10:00am and then saw d tracker,the driver was nowhere near to my place. Called him and explained the directions ,,no response till 10:10am.. finally booked ola cab and reached my office. Will never book uber again..this was d second time..\n",
      "Tried to use them to get to the airport in S. Francisco. First driver showed up and told us he didn't have a permit to get to the airport, so we had to get another, then the price went up from $29 to over $40 in less than 2 mins. I was charged for 'cancelling'. Odd since I am a first time user and it wasn't my fault! Thought I would give them another chance at National Airport DC. Driver could barely speak English, could not tell me how much the ride would be because he said \"Uber set the price. I don't know how much.\" WILL NEVER EVER BOTHER WITH UBER. I hope they don't last much longer. They are terrible, no way to contact anyone. I was charged TWO cancellation fees, would like a refund but good luck with that. Completely disgraceful treatment of its customers.\n",
      "Been using Uber daily for the past 2 months. At first no prob. Then the nightmare began. Out of nowhere I am being suddenly charged a booking fee of $1.65 for every ride I request. Uber explains the fee as a necessity to reduce operating costs. Why is that my problem? When you are in business you have operating costs. If you don't want these costs don't be in business. Sucking it your customers is as low a tactic as you can employ.\n",
      "I was ripped off for $150 for cleaning fee. After a night out, I call uber and got a ride home. I got in the front seat and got home within 12 minutes. The ride is about $7. I got a receipt for about $7. I have no idea the driver file a charge of $150 for cleaning until I look in my credit card bill. I never received the receipt for the $150 until I complain to uber. Apparently, my driver file a cleaning fee to my ride with pictures of the middle back seat being wet and a little mess. I was sitting in the front seat. And if I don't get an alert that the charge was going to tag on, where is the avenue where I can contest this charge. The mess could have been made by the previous rider or the driver lied and file s false report. But if I don;'t get the alert right away, there is no way for me to contest this. That's why this is a scam. I will suggest all rider to take pictures of the interior of the car before leaving the car. Just to be safe so that you don't get rape by Uber.\n",
      "I forgot something in my house. I asked the driver to hang on a minute. I jumped out, it took less than 2 minutes. I came back to the car and my purse was open. I did not notice till I was on the plane the driver stole $120.00 from my purse! Troy is his name, here is his phone number **. He is a 30 something ** man from Tennessee now in DC driving for Uber.\n",
      "Never seen before,  the driver don't come for pick up and charged me 5 pound cancellation fee , I called for an other driver , the estate charge was 17 pound maximum,  the driver confirm that it will be around 14 pound , they charged me 21 pound ._x000D_I been charged for the same distance 16 pound to 17 pound with golden line . I tried to call them their's no number for those people. This company is really rubbish . I will never use it again. _x000D_AVOID IT .\n",
      "My wife took UBER with my 3 years old son from MALDEN MA to EAST BOSTON MA to a clinic. When they get there my son throw up a little bit. He only drinks milk. He does not eat any food and even his doctor knows that he does not eat any food so my wife grab some baby wipes and clean most of it but the driver was rushing her and he told her DON'T WORRY. He never told my wife that she will end up paying anything.\n",
      "My daughter used uber for the first time today. She was very happy with the lady that assisted her. Sweet as can be her name was Gail. I was initially worried about her using the service at first. Gail picked her up from a school activity and it was a pleasant experience fir my daughter.\n",
      "First Uber, need to have a ASAP phone number !!People beware of your account your phone tablet DON\"T let anyone use it!!! Keep away from young people because they will use it, For instance an 13 yr old family member use another family member phone we know how some kids are be real, Well, this one stole the phone and went riding around visiting his friends which had moved. Yes, the mama please do not ask, Then the family member couldn't find his phone call for ride no ride. Now different drivers driving him around so I say, to drivers DUMMY\n",
      "I recently had uber charge me $150.00 for a trip that should be $16.00. The trip was from Soquel to Santa Cruz. The driver had my fare going from Soquel to S.F . Uber refuses to make the correct adjustments. Next  time I will request Jesse from Capitola .\n",
      "I have had nothing, but trouble dealing with UBER customer service. The only way to contact them is by email since there is NO phone number. Also, you get a reply from a different person each time you reply to an email. The UBER app became usable after a recent Android update, and this caused me to miss a meeting. UBER told me to just reload the app, use a desktop UBER app, download their app from their site instead of Google Play and finally said they fixed it but gave me no way to test it. I have now unloaded my UBER app and loaded LYFT, and they even paid me $50 for my first five rides, where UBER gave me nothing grief!\n",
      "I use my cards all over the world and have relied on taxis. My friends were telling me to try Uber so I did. The driver was great. However my payment wasn't accepted. The only customer service is by email which is more annoying than an IVR system. You get a response but you can tell it is either automated with the just the names changed or it is a copy and paste. There is no customer in their service. It's like speaking to a robot. I normally don't work with any company that doesn't have a customer service phone number and display it on their website, but I tried Uber because of the recommendations. After a couple of back and forth emails, they finally asked me to send photocopies of documents which further annoyed me. I probably won't use Uber again. I will take a taxi.\n",
      "Today I feel I was taken advantage of by UBER.  I am a loyal uber customer who has used UBER many times for work and personal use.  I have never run into what happened to me this morning with a ride charge of $68.97 US in New York.  When I requested a ride I was told the fair was approx $18 from my hotel to LGA Airport.  A surcharge screen then came up which advised me a 2.3 surcharge would apply to this rate.  I didn't understand it and read it as an additional 2.3%.  Now I am advised that it means actually an additional 2.3 rate.  Even at that 2.3 rate $18x2.3=$41 not $68.97.  When I received the uber receipt after the fact I was charged $68.97.  I would have never agreed to this.  A normal cab ride was $40.  I feel violated and cheated by Uber. This system is not set up right and is very confusing for the customer.  I won't be using UBER again as the company after numerous attempts will not help.\n",
      "We were in Fox Lake IL. We locked keys in our car. There was a Uber driver available to get us home.\n",
      "Customer service guys have nice word and trying to chat as very friendly team, but they do not have any solution. They just play a game.\n",
      "Holy sh!t!!! So, I have nobody in my life, on purpose. I'm chronically sick, and take care of myself. _x000D_Today I am convinced by EMS, against my better judgment to be taken to the ER, by them. Usually I drive myself. I think, oh yeah, Uber gives a first ride free, I'll get home that way. WRONG!_x000D_Code not working. One response from twitter and email support. I'm desperate, I feel like total crap. I'm basically trapped at the hospital after a horrible day. _x000D_I get completely desperate, phone about to die, I'm literally begging support to help. No response._x000D_I can't walk home, I have handicap plates if that says anything about walking two miles to the bus stop with my oh so generous bus pass from the hospital._x000D_Before the phone finally dies, I have to call the only person I even have a number for anymore, a previous abuser.

      "I booked an Uber car. I wait for the driver to come at least 15-20 mins, and I also call him feel time to check how long he can be here. Then the driver can find me. I asked him to drive the car to the bus station. He doesn't know where is it. He said he doesn't want to pick me, then he cancelled my booking. After that I received one email, said deduct $6.27 dollars from my bank card. I'm very angry is I never cancel the booking, why you charged me? This is my problem? I wrote an email to the Uber customer, they are no really to help to solve the problem. Make me very disjointed and waste my time. I would not and make any bookings from Uber again, and share my experience to my friends. What a terrible company.\n",
      "I was an Uber driver for five months. I became slighted over their referral program. Basically, you share your link with people you want to refer. After their 20th ride the driver receives the referral pay. The first person I referred Uber claimed that the person did not use my referral code. The person told them that she signed up through my link. This was how she found out about Uber. That was the first incident in which I just chucked up the loose. Next, I referred my Godchild. I received a notice that she had completed her 20 rides and I would be getting a payment. This was in February. \n",
      "I requested a ride at 7:45pm I  could see the driver on the map never leave his home. The driver calls me and tells me he is outside my home when I knew he wasn't I called back and the driver was very rude he was very rude I hate to say it but mostly all every African drivers I get from uber are rude and they always have an attitude. The driver told me he was not coming to pick me and hung on me I was then charged a cancellation fee when the driver was the one that cancelled the trip. I never have this issue with lyft uber needs to get better drivers I will not be taking another uber i will use lyft or walk to my destination. I find it ridiculous I have to deal with someone rude when they are getting paid to drive me around.\n",
      "I feel like i got scammed driving for uber. One example i made $141 over a period of 9 hours got $100 sounds good right WRONG! I put $30 in gas + 300 miles on my car. Now mind you im in a busy area by the airport. They take 28% of every ride + they charge the rider $2.30 booking fee. So i do 97% of the job take 100% of the risk and what do i get after maintaining the car tires, oil change, other expenses, car value going down? well you tell me i could be working at a gas station making more then $70 with my car value + my gas still in my car. Ohh and uber gets 100% of the profit taking ZERO RISK how is this called a service and not a scamm? Look all im saying is i feel like i got scammed. If you feel like you got scammed then you got scammed PERIOD! Its like i paid uber and i gave a bunch of people free rides. *$#% you uber.\n",
      "I was quoted $17 and when I entered the car the driver added a seat which raised my fare. He then did the same to the passenger who shared my ride. He denied it both times. Uber simply responded to me that I would be given a quote before entering which I was and still doesn't resolve my issue. The driver is scamming passengers. They don't track how often he is doing this?!?\n",
      "A friend and I took Uber from Murfreesboro, Tennessee to Nashville for a concert. When the concert was over, got on app for a ride back. It was 8.7 times normal rate. There were people everywhere trying to get a better rate. We were all in the same situation. A lot were college kids. Thank God a taxi came by and offered us a lot better rate. Surge pricing should be against the law and Uber should be heavily fined for this or shut down! Don't ever take Uber or be ready to their surge pricing! Never will I take Uber again!\n",
      "Most of customers are complaining about drivers being unprofessional because they passed nearby customer when the driver just received the request. The real thing is that Drivers are not responsible for SOFTWARE ISSUES!!! Uber is responsible for that. Uber need to adjust the software for server to pick up riders 3-4 minutes before arriving near customer, but because the programmers are following the UBER RULE to be aggressive taking very fast the customers, they cant solve real problems to pick up customers in a right order so no one cant mistake anything!! Like in a dual carriageway, server dont think that you need to turn around. \n",
      "Uber has charged my account for a ride that I did not even take. It was 4 a.m. Central Time and I was home asleep. Fair warning to all Uber users write down each and every time you request a ride and then match it with your checking account or credit card.\n",
      "$129.00 to travel across town in Boise. About 10 miles. 1st time used. Saturday on a non Holiday weekend. Mobile app is crap on advising you of your total cost until you get home and your email presents the shocking damage. Took over 13 minutes to get picked up too. SCAM!!\n",
      "I am upset that my 16-year-old son was allowed to ride Uber without my consent and without being accompanied by an adult. This occurred last night, Saturday, July 9, 2016. Why didn't any of the drivers check his ID. He looks every bit of 15. I see this as a problem because someone's child could be meeting up with a predator and end up dead somewhere... run away from home, etc. Nashville has got to do better and not just be concerned about making money. Be concerned about child safety.\n",
      "When I signed up for Uber I remember specifically asking the rep about damage and accidents. His reply was and I quote. \"Don't worry bro. If your app is on and you have an Uber rider in the vehicle, we got you covered. We have an insurance company that handles all that.\" I forget the guy's name. He was just one of dozens of people working at the busy little Uber sign up and inspection office. Well, guess what, my car WAS damaged while I had Uber riders in my car. They are Uber riders are they not? I am \"contracted\" by Uber to transport their customers? I know they refuse to call me and hundreds of thousands of other drivers \"employees\" but they can't deny that the riders are \"theirs\".\n",
      "In May 2016 I had my first and only experience using Uber. I wrote to the company, called, even complained to the Better Business Bureau. They have not responded. I took Uber from LaGuardia Airport to Brooklyn, less than 20 miles -- was charged $84.59, PLUS a bogus cancellation fee of $5.\n",
      "Requested a ride on my Uber app on July 3 from Eden Prairie, MN to Minneapolis, MN. The first driver went to the wrong location and didn't bother trying to contact me to see why I wasn't there; for this I was charged a $5 cancellation fee. My daughter looked at the app and noticed it said that my request hadn't gone through. She sent a new request and for some reason I was charged another cancellation fee, this one was for $6. The driver who did finally show up 30 minutes after my initial request charged me $60 for a 19 mile trip. For the return trip I tried Lyft and not only did the driver show up within 5 minutes of my request, he also only charged me $18.60! Guess which service I'll be using from now on and recommending to my family and friends? Hint: it's not Uber.\n",
      "I did an estimate on a trip that was supposed to only be an estimate price for $20. I didn't realize I picked a sub so after the ride I was charged $68.00. Why would I want to pay $68 if the taxi would of onlyour costed $30 I used Uber for over an year Iat not use uber anymore that was an outrageous price to pay for an $30 trip .\n",
      "I got an estimate fare which said my journey would've between Â£23-Â£31 but got charged Â£53. I complained and got nowhere\n",
      "Absolutely unethical and unfair to drivers. I drove with Uber for almost two years and am ready to delete my App and switch to Lyft. I have clear evidence (screenshots) of multiple occasions where I picked up riders in 1.8 or over surge zone but was paid regular fare. Their regular fare is so low that almost 50% of my trips are under $5 each after Uber fee deduction... Such a joke. No one would let you sit in your car for $3 or something, let alone driving for 1-2 miles to pick the person, drive them another 2-3 miles, spend about 10 minutes of your time and get paid $5 or less... Not to mention that kind of people you end up dealing with, from drug possessing people to those carrying their stupid McDonald burgers into your car, which you then have to drive your car for miles with windows open to get rid of the smell. \n",
      "I called Uber for a ride to the airport in NY. I waited two hours, missed my plane which cost me $300.00 for a new flight. First hour I received text driver had arrived but he was not there. I recalled Uber received text from second driver I waited another hr., again no show. I sent a text to company, finally second driver called me. He could not pick me up because road work blocked his route. I tried to explain different route or stay where he was and I would walk down the street to him. His English was so poor he did not understand either. Received text second driver canceled. To top it off Uber charged my credit card for renting a car in Calf. I have never been in Calf.\n",
      "Uber lies about their incentives. For example they say $50 an hour for Lake Tahoe driving. The terms are you have to complete one ride per hour at least. However they will not give you one ride per hour. The only thing they want is more driver in that City. You will not get the $50 because they don't give you one ride per hour. They just want more driver so it will be available when customers request.\n",
      "I took an Uber from Downtown Manhattan to Port Authority (42nd & 8th Ave.) and it costs $50!!! Are you kidding me right now!!! First of all the driver obviously didn't know what avenue to take even after I told him. 1 hour to get to midtown... pure BS. And why was it sooo expensive. Because the base fare is $7.00 and then $13.16 for 3.51 miles and then $31.51 for the 49 minutes that I wasted in the damn car. Grand total $51.67. Never again... And I would advise everyone to stay away from Uber if you don't want to get ripped off!!!\n",
      "Never could get a confirmation.  My G.P.S. was floating.  They said my phone was not valid.   In Chicago, it's not worth the delay.   NEVER again, this has been disgusting.\n",
      "Up until 2 days ago, I had been an Uber partner for over a year and must say their practices are very questionable. 1st point, DRIVERS. How can a company claim they do \"background\" checks, and on countless occasions have the drivers be a bunch of menacing idiots, providing questionable rides in even more questionably safe cars, all the while being more focused on his/her phone conversation than the road. SERIOUSLY?! Now if these checks were, in fact, being done, then why the battle for not allowing drivers to be fingerprinted? It's an honest question, and quite frankly, a legit one. You claim your drivers are safe, but are unwilling to back that up with something so simple as fingerprinting?! LET THE BUYER BEWARE! \n",
      "I have been an Uber driver for a few months now. Uber drivers beware. If you have a rider who is going to get sick in your car, get them out of your vehicle as quickly as possible. Uber does not protect you against damages to your vehicle and getting them to get reimbursement for damage to your vehicle is like pulling teeth. One of my riders got sick in my vehicle. First I tried to download the pictures to their app under \"My rider damaged my vehicle...\" The app doesn't allow me to download. I had to go down to the Uber Center location because Uber doesn't have any over the phone representatives to support you when damage occurs. \n",
      "The surge pricing is a huge scam! I was charged $93 for a $45 ride in a car that was falling apart! I could have had a limo for $85.\n",
      "In my opinion, Uber does not live up to the ethical standards they claim to have and does not respect their customers. I will avoid Uber to the best of my ability going forward and have moved to using Lyft which is much better. Here's my experience: I left very nice expensive speakers on the back seat of his Uber and sent an email to Uber later that day which said I should contact the driver.\n",
      "Someone stole my car on Father's day, June 19th. So my aunt suggested I use Uber. I'm in medical school with one more year to go. My school is 5.5 miles away from my house. On Tuesday morning June 21 I requested Uber, the trip cost 9.97. To get back home it was 9.98. Ok I was cool with that. But on Thursday morning it was 17.87. I didn't expect that. I told everybody who would listen at my medical school and many people had the same story. Advice I got was to just get up a little earlier and get a cab the fare will be 7 dollars. Three days of coming and going with Uber I am 60 dollars in. One of my schoolmates felt for me and offered me a ride home Thursday.\n",
      "Three time is one week I had to fight them on so called \"guarantees\". First on a guarantee for referring passengers which I sent approximately 7 emails back & forth before they upheld their simply $20 guarantee and also twice for a special weekend guarantee where they wanted as many drivers on the road and promised a specific amount of money which not only did they not back up, I had to go back and forth again with them on it. If they upheld their policies, I'd give them 5 stars. The people you meet, drivers and riders are awesome. Unfortunately, the company lies constantly. What a shame.\n",
      "Always have good experience with Uber but I think their quality is declining. I booked an Uber today. 1990 toyota camry, AC was not ON and didnt work. the seat had some kind of plastic cover which made the experience ever worst. wanted to keep bag in the trunk but the trunk was junk. The driver was irritating kept asking how long have you been in Chicago. He had phone in one hand and was driving with the other and kept missing the direction even though it was clear on his cell phone on he route we were taking. I will think twice before requesting an Uber because a Cab provides me with better experience then Uber\n",

      "On 06/14/2016 a little after 9 am one of the drivers for Uber came down my driveway and tried to turn through my grass instead of backing out like he came and not only destroyed but landscaping, took out the water fountain but mowed down my kids' large swing set. We reached out to Uber who told my son who was in the car at the time of the accident that an adjuster would be coming out to assess the damages. We have never heard from them again. They are accountable as this is the driver they hired to drive for them and that man should not be driving anyone around. Also he could have killed my son! Something needs to be done about this!\n",
      "I had 6-7 free rides which I was rewarded by referring my friends. Yesterday I referred one of my friend and she received first free ride and took a ride. I received a mail stating that I have earned free ride of 125/-. I then booked a cab in Uber but when I reached my destination I was charged the whole amount. I opened the app after paying the driver and saw there was no free rides available for me whereas day before yesterday I saw 6 free rides which were not expired also. I immediately mailed to customer help and they replied that I have misused my account to get a free ride. This is ridiculous. \n",
      "I used uber when traveling to NY to see my brother James. He lives next to Jamaica station and  usually I take a cab from jfk to his place that adds up to as much as $70 for a ride.

      "Daughter and friends took Uber NJ to Philly for $50, great! BUT to get home they charged them $250... when they got an estimate of $25-30.

      "I am an UBER Driver.  UBER is a fundamentally dishonest company.  First of all, in over two years of driving, I've never met or spoken to anyone who works for the company.  It's all done via email.  Second, anytime you write them for any reason, you receive a canned response that shows your original email was neither read nor comprehended by a human. Then they won't adjust fares when you've been shorted until you've sent at least five or six emails.   Finally, they'll relent, usually.  You'll get multiple responses that are canned and look like dialogue from Valley Of The Dolls.  _x000D_The people who get in your car are sometimes smelly and your car will smell the next day.  Also, UBER is a terrible corporate citizen. .85 cents a mile/.75 cents for UBER Pool plus .13 per minute means that when you deduct .575 cents a mile while riders are in the car and .575 cents per mile to get to the rider, you'll LOSE MONEY ON EACH AND EVER RIDE!  This means a full time UBER Driver will never pay a dime in taxes, qualify for Social Security or have any money in life.  All full time UBER drivers will end up a burden to the government while their cars have been polluting the environment.  _x000D_The Wussy County Commissions all across the country that have rolled over for this company are anything but public servants.  They are fools.  If you want a cheap ride, do not care about taking advantage of other humans and like rewarding a greedy morally bankrupt corporation, by all means, continue too use UBER.  _x000D_Also, UBER Pool -- You get into a car with people you don't know and a driver you don't know.  You go on a route you don't need to go on.  As a driver, you're a rolling day care center for drunks.  UBER Company calls us drivers partners.  That's CRAP.  They treat us as if we're illiterate, mentally challenged minors.   They lie, threaten, and constantly sell lie after lie after lie.  My prediction is UBER will continue to have success for a long time ahead but will come to be vilified as the horrific example of greed that they are.  _x000D_Their treatment of people and disregard for our environment, our laws, and most of all the safety and well being of their drivers is as egregious as any company in the history of America.  The Pussy Politicians that are rolling over for this company are also an embarrassment to our country.\n",
      "I've had countless issues with uber drivers claiming false cancellations, claiming to have picked me up when they hadn't, etc. Tonight a guy picked me up and immediately started hinting that I lived too far away. Mid way through the ride he finally concluded that I did,in fact, live too far away (he just wasn't familiar with the New York area at ALL- NO, Brooklyn isn't in Manhattan). He kicked me out of the car in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood and cancelled the ride. I had to walk with my three heavy bags all the way home because of other issues with false cancellations and uber. Lyft isn't much better but fewer terrible experiences for sure.\n",
      "Too much words are needed to explain about this big scam ,whether you are a driver or a rider.  I have experienced both sides. Uner is collecting your information and selling them and ripping off the driver and the rider both!  Stay away from this evil at any cost !\n",
      "First, I requested an Uber driver that was 6 minutes away from me in an appropriate amount of time before I needed to get to my destination. I needed to be at the airport by 8:30 a.m. and contacted Uber at 7:40. I didn't want to have to pay for parking at the airport. When I requested the Uber driver I saw that he has 4 out of 5 stars and figured he would be a good driver. _x000D_    However, the driver seemed to be lost and had no clue where he was. He passed my street four times, which my street is not that difficult to find! He kept making U-turns and turning down the wrong streets. _x000D_   For a driver, you're suppose to know where you're going! And if you don't know, follow the GPS! It was an awful experience that I had with Uber. I had to pay an outrageous price for parking at the airport and was late for my flight! If the driver just knew where he was going or knew how to use a GPS then this issue wouldn't be an issue!_x000D_    Since I canceled the Uber ride they want to charge me for a cancelation fee! Uber really needs to test their drivers to see if they're smart enough to use a GPS. Although, you'd think it would be common knowledge... I guess not.\n",
      "I drive four fares for Uber. People please; don't go into this business. I've read some poor people actually buy newer cars in order to drive on Uber?! You have got to do your math. Decisions like that have to be done educatedly. I live in Jacksonville, FL where the average rate is .75 cents per mile. Uber ONLY pays a driver while the rider is having the ride to their destination. The IRS values every mile you ride in your car at about 55 cents. That is the cost for gas and wear and tear on your vehicle. Then comes the driving you do to the point where your rider is; and after you drop your rider off to the next rider. Uber does not reimburse a cent for that. So your actual revenue is less than 20 cents per mile. That could be about 2.00 dollars per hour. It's way less than minimum federal wage.\n",
      "It is a ripoff for both drivers and riders. Uber gets the money and your car and pocket suffers. Not to mention the safety issues. I drove for Uber for two days; 4 rides. Up to 19 per hour?? Not even close! More like 2.00 per hour not mention you only get paid for the ride to the riders to their destination. The rest is on you!_x000D_http://digg.com/video/uber-scam-rip-off-for-drivers\n",
      "I used this once in America, I was advised to get the app which I did. 10 months later they have taken nearky Â£300 out my bank account.!!!. I'm. In touch with the fraud team now it's stress I can do without...\n",
      "I called Uber this morning to schedule a pick-up. When the driver arrived, the name on his I.D. was different from the name given me during scheduling. He said he needed to have payment in cash ($8.00). As I was going to be late for a doctor's visit, I paid him the cash. Uber then charged my bank account for the fare. I have tried to reach Uber numerous times, numerous ways, with no response. A customer service phone number instructs me to contact them online. Their website suggests I sign-in to report an issue, but when I hit the button to do so, I get a note that says \"Page Not Found\". Horrible, unreliable service and drivers... too good to be true.\n",
      "On April 9, 2016 at 1:00 am I requested a car from lower Manhattan to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn which is a long ride. I watched as the map showed the car getting closer and only 1 minute away. I waited for another 10 minutes but the driver never showed. Then the driver canceled the ride. I tried again and another car was coming and never showed. Also the app showed the driver around the corner a minute away. After 10 more minutes I canceled. My friend who was with me requested a car from lower Manhattan to the Upper East Side in Manhattan and guess what, the driver showed. Uber charged me two cancellation fees and I had to take the subway at 1:30 am for an hour and a half to Brooklyn.\n",
      "Uber drivers are not held to the same standards as cab drivers.  They often cancel your ride and the company will put the charge onto your credit card. I have been trying to get 2 of those charges off of my card now for months with no resolution, having sent at least 8 emails to numerous individuals. It seems like you can never connect with the same person to solve your problem and there is absolutely no way to make contact by phone. I also tried to get an Uber out of the country and the guy just never showed. Another driver had no idea how to get to the airport that was 15 minutes away and took a route that took over an hour and I was almost late for my flight.  Be wary travelers!\n",
      "I live in melbourne australia. i had a early morning hospital appointment today. only my seccond time using the service and i will never use again. it cost me double it would have had i waited for a cab. incidently the app told me i would be altered to a drop in surge if any in 30 mins!! in that time i could have and should have called a normal taxi.clear scam there considering this service is supposed to be on demand and i did not have the time to wait aroung for 30  mins for ubers claculations. but i wwas not prepared for it to be so outragously overpriced._x000D_i believe the app scams by telling you to wait till the surge drops or pay a series of charges. I'm on my way to the hospital waiting in the cold i dont have time to break down the charge list nor did i expect that in such a short distance i would be charged double._x000D_  what should have been a 25 dollar fare to over 50!!!  _x000D_we caught a cab on the way back it was quick , hassale free and fare appropiate. UBER you just lost a customer and i will be letting others know about my experience.\n",
      "We took an uber home thinking it would be better than driving. It was a 25.09 ride which is absolutely fine, but a surcharge of over 50 dollars is absolute ridiculous. Our trip was 12 miles and we paid over 77 dollars. I have tried to call, email, anything to talk to a person and nothing has happened. Uber is absolutely ridiculous with the way they charge people. So disappointed in the company.\n",
      "Started driving for Uber Nov 2015. Made good money so upgraded my vehicle March 2016. But due to tags being TNC, can't transfer unless TNC is removed. Now trying to reapply with Uber and I'm getting the run's. Even the referred driver I invited now after they completed the required 50 trips they told me that the driver didn't meet a requirement but which requirement? They won't list nor directly tell me also why my background isn't going through. Would never again refer anymore contacts to this faults lying. No real contact by landline place to anyone. Also watch your taxes. They don't report that 20-35% they take from you on you 1099 naughtier. Eye Wide Open!!!\n",
      "I have noticed in the past months a serious decline in Uber service. Drivers are incredibly unprofessional. For example, today I was late to work so I requested an Uber. A driver accepted my request and the app showed he was just 3 minutes away. As I am waiting, I see the car move away from my location instead of closer. I call the driver, who tells me he is coming around. After waiting another 8 minutes, and seeing he is indeed coming around, he suddenly- and for no reason - cancels the trip when he is just a half block away. \n",
      "Noticed activity on my iPhone today saying that my Uber ride was en route - well that was interesting as I was working from home and had not called Uber so I cancelled it without thinking anything was wrong. Went to drive my car to yoga and a new message comes up about my Uber driver is en route! Now I am curious so I go into my account and see that there were several rides since midnight - one for nearly $500. the interesting part was they were in Detroit and I am in Atlanta and had not been to Detroit in over six months and I always rent a car when there. In any case I send a message that I think there has been fraudulent activity and briefly explain what is going on - no response nothing! So I call the driver that is supposedly picking me up and tell him that I am in ATL that this is a fraudulent ride - he hangs up on me. \n",
      "Uber is totally taking advantage and overcharging! They charged me over $100 for 10mile ride! Ridiculous!\n",
      "I have never heard of a multi-million dollar business that doesn't have a contact number for its customers to contact for service, support or assistance. Absolutely ridiculous, sounds like they are trying to avoid the public... I refuse to give this company any more of my money until they recognize the importance of public relations and communications.\n",
      "I was at the airport and figured I would try Uber ..first guy ..we went around in circles _x000D_Trying to navigate the map..

I hope they do not charge_x000D_Me doe those two cancelations that would be the icing on the cake.. Uber you suck_x000D_Bigtime\n",
      "The initial fare was almost double what the return fare cost and this was done to cover the \"free ride\" discount! The distance varied by 2 miles, also, to and from my appointment. I used Uber in the Morning of May 25, 2016 to take a \"12.86\" mile trip (which was actually shown to be 9.86 miles) for an appointment. I was not told the price at all so there was no disclosure made. I was promised an discounted ride I signed up. This is an Unfair Trade Practice, and it is a Bait & Switch tactic. I believe that the FTC and the U.S. Dept of Consumer Protection should investigate Uber. There may be cause to impose fines and/or imprisonment. This may also be Consumer Fraud which carries a minimum of a $50,000 Punitive Damages penalty.\n",
      "A few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home. It was very late, and when I had gotten in the cab, the driver seemed really aloof and tired. I was very courteous, asked him how his night was, and the response I got was very groggy and rude. Regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone, I started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned. I asked politely if he could slow down and again, he answered with a rude tone of voice._x000D_A few days go by and I get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged $165.00 !!!!! The driver had accused me of vomiting in his car!!! And took \"fake photos\" and sent them to uber! It was appalling! And the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting. It looked liked mushy popcorn and water, and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car. Was just so gross. _x000D_Never in my life have I thrown up in someone's taxi cab, and if I had felt sick, I would have politely told the man to pull over. I was not sick, I was not drunk, and I remember the ride clearly. Nothing along those lines had happened and I am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible. Not only did he accuse an innocent passanger, but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account. TERRIBLE!!!!!\n",
      "I have been driving for uber for over nine months it was bad enough when they lowered the rates for our work, I got past that and kept on driving... Well last week in my review, they. Gave me a low score saying a rider said my vehicle didn't meet their standard of cleanliness, this was not true because I am constantly cleaning my vehicle and passengers are always ccomplementing me on. How fresh my vehicles smells, after passengers are in and out of your vehicle you will realistically have some sand in the floor, there is no way to logically and safely vacuum your car out between the hours of 10pm and 4am that's makes no sense which is what they tried to suggest to clean the car after each fare.  How?? If u get trips back to back when do you clean of course if someone vomits you're going to clean that mess up... But to top it off when they said the car wasn't clean they took the opportunity to throw in There saying remember your PERSONAL HYGIENE as well, which was not even the comment.. I was personally offended and have not driven sense.. I am a clean person and just because my car was not emuculate enough for one rider shouldn't have turned into the opportunity to insult me... I know it was an automated response, but those two responses need to be separated from each other because they are two separate issues...\n",
      "Uber did not get my payment because the credit card was outdated. I would like to solve the matter but have not been able to do this on line. I am not going to spend 10 hours on line trying to figure this out since I am not that technical. A number to reach Uber would be nice._x000D_The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the driver was great. Customer service??????????...There is absolutely no customer service!!!..really..none! You will never ever be able to speak to anyone. If your question is not in their category of FAQ's then forget it. So how does that make you feel as a customer?  Sounds to me like they don't want to talk to the people who are making their business grow. They are now on my do not call list.\n",

      "This past Friday, May 13, 2016 at 4:40 p.m., I wanted to try the new UBER app to order a car. It was raining and I am disabled. I followed all the instructions on the APP 1. pickup location 224 West 57 Street & Broadway 2) destination, Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn. etc. and they sent me the name of the driver and you can see how far away he is from your location. I was waiting for the price of the ride which I thought should be automatically; some kind of confirmation number so I can have the option to not accept the car. The driver came and I figured he would know, as soon as I told him where I had to go, he was complaining that the trip was too far, a lot of traffic for Friday and it is raining. I asked him how much is the ride. He had no idea, but he kept saying to me it is an estimated price. There is no set price. That was not what I expected, so I asked what will the estimate be he said up to $200.00 due to the rain, heavy traffic. \n",
      "I took a 13.00 fare to pick up a car for my company. I had all of my stuff, which included 2 phones. As soon as the driver left I realized I forgot 1 of the phones which I with android device manager while emailing both he and Uber support 7 times each over the course of the next hour. The driver answered his phone once and obviously knew I was calling about my phone as the Uber automated system tells him that when it auto calls. He hung up and then did not answer again for another hour. Uber responded back with \"wait a while\". After the hour of trying I texted and left a VM that simply said, \"I know you have my phone because I can see it on GPS, please call me back.\" Well this moron obviously is not aware of gps technology and probably figured he was caught so he called me back. The conversation was unintelligible as he repeated over and over that he wasn't in my city any longer and couldn't get right back. \n",

I tip the guy decently in cash for getting me home finallyGet inside, my wifi loads up UBER receipt$79!!!!!!! for a 15 minute ride...........NEVER AGAIN\n",
      "I'm in New York and trying to catch a cab to the airport.  It is pouring down rain and the taxis are busy.  I decided that I would try UBER.  The app kept timing out on my iPhone then it came up and said UBER Pool.  I'm thinking OK I will share a ride and save some money. LaGuardia is only 7.5 miles away and it usually about $35 for a cab fare.  It took about 15 minutes but I was willing to wait to I didn't miss my flight   I had a very nice driver and a nice car but he couldn't tell me how much.  I was the only passenger so I thought OK I got lucky and no one else is going to the airport since it said UBER Pool.  I had no other choices anyway.  I have a computer training business so I am very savvy with technology.  I arrived at the airport and he said it would compute the fee but he couldn't tell me how much because the app had also put in JFK and not LaGuardia which is not what I chose.  Maybe another potential customer not sure.  I got the receipt and was charge $179 for the short trip.  When I contacted UBER they said since it was busy they could charge me 3.6 times the normal fair.  That is really taking advantage of your customers.  I don't think my customers would be happy if I told them since they scheduled their training on a very busy day that my rate would be 3 or 4 times more than normal.  This is price gouging.  I will NEVER EVER use UBER again.\n",
      "Uber is charging very high and looting the money, I feel both Uber and OLA are like sister companies, Have collaborated behind screen to loot the money of ppl. One question is, is morning 6: 30 AM Peak time for you both? Shame.\n",
      "I'm at the Sheraton in downtown Seattle and the drivers can't find the place. Trying to get to the airport and the first one drove down to Pike's Market before I cancelled. The secomd one took 10 minutes to get here even though it said 1 minute away.\n",
      "Uber can be hit or miss._x000D_On my first Uber ride:Going out with friends from a hotel we were staying at in Savannah, Ga. They ordered a ride and it was a great experience, no problems and a courteous knowledgably driver. _x000D_On the second night out: After receiving a ride downtown on the hotel shuttle, we had dinner and went out exploring the nightlife. Then we order Uber and the app said they were 10 minutes away, no problem. As we followed the drivers progress at about 5 minute out, he called to confirm our location and said hed be there shortly. A few minutes later his location was off and we did not see him on the app. We called back his number and he said he is going to take another fare and we need to find a different ride. What an SOB you are Biell! By this time we were tired and frustrated. We saw a taxi and took that back to the hotel. _x000D_The moral of the story: you cant trust Uber and you need a backup plan.\n",
      "The truth is that Uber sucks. What we need is serious improvement on the taxi system rather than replacing it with a gigantic corporation that has way, waaay too much power in a unregulated market. Uber is too big to be controlled and that is a serious threat workers and consumers. I had an important medical appointment yesterday. I'm being treated with scheduled shots for a serious medical condition. The Uber driver who was supposed to pick me up cancelled the trip because of surging prices. Each and every time I tried to get an Uber car it was the same thing. The app showed the car arriving in a few minutes, but you could see the car taking turns and driving around to have me cancelling the trip and allowing him to make more money on another trip due to surging rates. It has happened many times in the past and the internet is full of negative reviews stating the very same problem, which I've heard from friend in Brazil as well.\n",
      "My interaction with UBER support has turned out to be very unprofessional with an unfair final decision leading me to ask how can anyone count on such company to stand up for their well being and safety as a partner. UBER will not assist his partners in any safety incidents but rather take a step back and cut all ties whenever you as a partner find yourself in a situation that would qualify to be dangerous for your safety. I got assaulted, got some weird smelly liquid sprayed inside my car with no idea of what it was, a bottle thrown at me, my car kicked by that same rider (luckily there wasn't any dents), and then when I call the safety line to report the incident, my account got terminated for having to physically remove that rider when she tries to jump back inside my car while I am not even in it. \"God knows what her intentions were.\" Do the math.\n",
      "I use Uber service very often and liked the service until the recent experience. I called for UberX service for my family pick up from the airport. All went well until next day new charged appeared by Uber called \"upcharge\". Apparently I had 5 passengers in a 4 max car service. Driver never notified me of this policy or garage us a warning and drove us. Later on Uber decided to \"up charged\" due to extra passenger. I believe this is illegal since I was never told of this potential extra charge. Consumer should be given a upfront notice prior to picking up a passenger.\n",
      "understand that theses people use there own cars and uber will deactivate them over any lie or lower than 4.5 star if we appreciate better service then show it by rating drivers well don't want it like the old days again wait 30 minutes or more for a taxi treat uber drivers right\n",
      "I have a worst experience in UBER. Most Cheated company, worst drivers, rash driving. Never ever think to book this cab.  I am not getting the option of negative rating.\n",
      "I have been using them for a while and it was great. However, recently I noticed that they are charging me at their own free wish and disregard my numerous concern or question to help. These are some of my observation on my recent use: App shows they are 1 minute away, so you click on them to pick you, then they won't show off until 15 to even 30 minutes (in freezing cold winter, snowy or rainy days).\n",
      "I have been in business for myself for over 30 years and started driving for Uber at the behest of my wife and daughter, who thought I would have fun driving for them. I told them that I thought it was ridiculous to treat your personal car as a cab hauling people around with all costs of operation including risk on your own back, then UBER taking 25% plus riders fee as their take for virtually doing nothing except using their software. A truly incredible business model though...for them to get rich, not you...ever. No one was ever able to explain to me if it actually made dollar sense to drive, so I took a one month part time challenge driving 70 hours total on some weekdays and some weekends. Don't believe the liars who say they make $1,500 a week or more. They would have to work non-stop to even come close, and even then, the other costs that Uber takes and the cost of maintenance, insurance, gas, etc. would make that evaporate. \n",
      "I was ripped off many times, overcharged by uber and when want to ask or complain, they of course have a bridge to nowhere type of system where it is impossible to actually state your complain, it is categorized where you can not find the right button. It also seems there is no real response\n",
      "Tried using Uber and my driver never left his seat to help with our suitcases.  He also charged much more than the taxi drivers and insisted on $5 tip which he didn't deserve.   Every taxi driver we used helped us with our suit cases and this man never lifted a finger!!!  The taxi drivers were less expense and much more friendly.  He did get us to our destination.\n",
      "It took 3 days in London & numerous tries to finally get a ride. The online demo looked so simple. Not so!\n",
      "I have been using Uber religiously for 2-3 months now. Everyone had bad things to say about not trusting them, but because I had mostly good experiencing I defended them, UNTIL! They started to charge you however they feel, the app says if you cancel 5 mins after you've requested, you get charged, fair enough! But I have requested and wasn't happy with my wait time and cancelled within seconds and was charged. On 3 occasions this happened, fortunately they credit back my account. Once, a driver cancelled on me because he PREFERRED a trip to downtown Toronto, I got charged for that. They refunded it too after I disputed it.\n",
      "I've been using Uber regularly for about a year now. I have had only positive experiences so far, except for one instance when a driver tried to scam me. She accepted my request, and a minute or so later, the app status suddenly changed to \"on trip.\" I thought this was very strange and assumed perhaps there was a glitch or maybe the driver had accidentally hit the wrong button, so I canceled and requested again. I was connected to the same driver, but surely enough the app said I was on my way after a few moments. Again, I wanted to give my driver the benefit of the doubt and I chalked it up to the fact that I haven't updated Uber yet. However, I noticed that her car was starting to move along the route toward my destination. Interesting. I thought maybe she was trying to turn somewhere, but she just kept going, and it became clear that she was going to take me where I wanted to go without me in the car at all.\n",
      "I called Uber to go home, usually I get charged less than $5. Yesterday night after work I called an UBER. I noticed that the driver took a different route, I even asked him and he said the GPS was telling him the direction. I got home and got charged $6.12. No problem, everything was fine. Then today, I got an email saying that the driver miscalculated the mins or whatever so I got charged additional $20.40. I AM SO UPSET! I FEEL SCAMMED BY SOMETHING I TRUSTED for 2 years. Please don't ride UBER anymore. Some drivers are greedy and want money out of their passengers. Too bad he scammed the wrong person. I am not stopping until I get my money back. I already told my family and friends that UBER is a scam. I don't want them to experience what happened to me. Do not trust Uber. \n",
      "Opened the app with my iphone and was told I needed to go to my email. That never happened before. I don't have access to my primary email with my cell because I DON'T NEED TO. they have everything they need from me already amex platinum/email/picture/ all that stupid $#*! ALREADY. I get home and contact them and they have no answer for anything. Told me I should go to the community and talk about it. I'm 56 years old/own my own business/made over $400K last year.

I told him I didn't request a car or service yet. 3 hours later another driver showed up and told me rudely that he was going to charge me regardless. And I showed him my phone and it stated that I didn't click anything. So I deleted the app and will not sign up. If charged I will sue this company for their stupidity.\n",
      "It's been 2 years that we are using uber, but the kind of issues we have faced in past 2 months have totally washed away the past 2 years of good experience. I'll explain the major episodes-_x000D_1. Maruti Ritz- Me and my husband were travelling  from sector 57 gurgaon and sec 14 gurgaon, my husband had to get down at huda city which was midway. There are 3 ways for this route, when we asked him to take the huda route he said i can't do this otherwise I'll be in loss, I'll move according to the navigation. We told him that this concept is for car pool, but he continuously kept on saying that you don't know, i am the employee i know. He continuously kept on howling \"mai apki wajah se apna nuksan thode na karaunga\". After damn frustration we asked him to call the customer care and ask, even after knowing the fact, what he again misbehaved and said that \"hum aisa isliye karte hain taki ap baad me ye na kaho k galat raste pe le gye navigation k hisab se\". He was not silent for a min till 3/4th the way. This is highly unacceptable._x000D_2. We both had to travel from gurgaon to delhi, it was sunday eve not too much traffic also. We booked uber thrice. The first driver 6:08 pm when we called him after 5 min he said that he cant go to delhi.. in car pool its not possible._x000D_Second driver 6:14 pm, we called him within 2 min, he also asked where u hv to go, i disconnected the phn. He again called to ask the destination, i didn't tell. He said ok, he was jst 5 min away, we kept on waiting for 10 min, no response,.when we called to check,  he switched off his phn. Then also we waited and kept on calling for 15 min then finally he cancelled the trip. _x000D_Third driver 6:39 pm- he too was just 5 min away , for half an hour he kept on saying that i m searching whereas he was not. At last we asked him to reach rail vihar the nearest landmark, its clearly seen in the map, finally he replied \" madam mujhe search karna nahi ata\". Then i shouted and said that i am going to make a complain, he was at rail vihar within a min, bt we had already cancelled the trip._x000D_We were late by 1 and a half hour, moreover we were damn frustrated._x000D_Finally then i booked uber from my phn and we got the cab._x000D_3. Today in the morning, i made a request for own car from sec 57 to 14 gurgaon. A driver mahinder, hundai accent accepted the request and said that its in pool and he is going to dwarka delhi. The rider he was having was also saying that i didn't opted for pool. He asked me to cancel, so i did. I was booking it for office, in hurry._x000D_I again sent a request and again he only accepted and when i called him, he replied i have to take this request otherwise \"meri ye trip waste ho jayegi\" i don't know how. I said i havent opted for car pool, I'll be late for office how does it matters to me k apki trip waste ho jayegi. So what he replied was, he actually shouted that \"to mujhe kya farq padta hai k apko late ho raha hai\"._x000D_I have actually referred uber to many of my knowns, i now feel like writing these reviews everywhere. This is just not acceptable. These are only the major issues that i hv mentioned, and it actually doesn't matter if u cut their day's incentive when we are facing so many issues with so many drivers. They take advantage of your 6 trip incentive method and it will deteriorate uber's image, u should make it km based incentive method Uber is working only becoz of customers. Dont lose them.\n",
      "Uber app is just too fast to be good.Cab bookings are misfired .even when a user is just exploring the app and is not really ready to book a ride. we get a call from the cab driver. Cab rides get booked even before you could select your destination. Then the cab drivers informs you to cancel that ride (which you anyways did not actually intend to book). If you fail to cancel within 15 minutes, you have to pay a cancellation charge (gets added to your next ride) _x000D_Uber app must have a \"confirm\" button so that the ride is booked only after that confirmation\n",
      "I reported someone  who stole my debit card and stole over $200.00 from my account.  They did absolutely  nothing.  Someone told me via email someone has to pay for them to get around. I couldn't even speak to anyone.\n",
      "My best friend was driving for Uber, mostly on busy nights, when the rates were high, and when the surge area was busy, so I went with her a few times, so she feels safe. They ripped my friend off with her getting paid. Emailed her and said passengers complained and said she seemed intoxicated, and driving too fast, and speeding, which is Not true.\n",
      "We arrived at San Fransisco Airport and walked towards the taxi rank.We were approached by a taxi driver offering to take us to our hotel he did say he was a Uber driver ( I do not have an Uber account). I knew that the fare should be around $45. During the journey our driver was constantly on his mobile phone either texting or speaking to other drivers. Arriving at our hotel he charged us $95._x000D_I my opinion don't use them, i certainly will never use them again.\n",
      "very poor services. the person doesnot know the exact address. controlled by false messages. false rate.\n",
      "On the evening of 5th April 2016 I called for an Uber car to take me from Dallas/Fort Worth airport to the west side of Fort Worth. I had just come in on a flight from California. Betty showed up in a white Mitsubishi Gallant. She lives in Irving and works the mid-cities area. We traveled to my destination and had pleasant and polite conversation on the way. I sat in the front of the car. Soon after the ride was complete I was informed that my ride was $46.43 which was reasonable for the distance traveled. The next day I received a tag on fee of $200 to cover clean-up of vomit on the front seat of the car. I checked on Google to find that the vomit scam is alive and well and apparently 'Uber Betty' is using this to screw her passengers and boost her income. I was emailed bogus pictures of my vomit.\n",
      "My son used UBER to and from school which is 3 miles at least 3 days a week @ approximately 7$ each way. Lately, UBER has increased dramatically from 7$ to 37$. Talk about taking advantage of the consumer. A taxi would've been more reasonable. I'm so disappointed with this company and gladly have deleted my account!!!\n",
      "Why is Uber such a fraud at pricing and worst at customer service?Please answer it.Being Billion Dollar industry and using treachery and fraud to charge customers?What happened to convenient ride at economic cost??For 2.5 km you might pay 100-120 Rupees(Indian)?Why because its peak time.IS it??I don't see any traffic on the road.Lol!! Their tantrums are worst than 11-year-old...I don't know what training their drivers receive.All they want is incentive and no attention to customer convenience\n",
      "I have been now been told/advised that at twenty-seven Uber charges on my credit card within the past three months. During this time my father got sick. He went hospital stage 4 cancer and the hospice and passed away. No I wasn't paying attention to these little tiny charges but the driver should have been. How can you take someone, make an Uber account and then not ever show a credit card? They don't have the credit card. They have an internet so what is it? We're not match driver's license to a credit card. What is wrong with you people? You are as much to blame as the people that I'm getting thrown in jail. You need to change your policies Uber account. You need to have a driver's license or not a driver's license because you don't have a car but something that can show who you are and they're not stealing people's credit accounts or PayPal accounts to ride in your damn car. Should be ashamed of yourself.\n",
      "I take uber 6 x per week to and from work for over a year now. The charge is 30.00 each way. Last Sunday @ 800 pm they charged me an extra 35.00 for the exact same ride. It was not a holiday. The weather was good, no reason for that ridiculous price. When I wrote to complain they gave me a ridiculous reply. I hate what they do to the people of nyc.\n",
      "I traveled with the Uber Swift car (MH-14 FC 1375) at Hinjewadi,Pune Maharatstra. I am travelling at night time the driver is not driving car properly and always looking at the mirror._x000D_I change my place the he again adjust the mirror toward me.

      "My Uber driver took me 20 minutes out of the way, causing my fare to be $36 instead of $18. I complained to Uber, but to no avail. What a crappy company.\n",
      "Recently, the Uber rates were lowered to a rate that significantly beats the rate to the standard yellow taxis in the city (NYC). Yet Uber finds a way to always scam the customer with ridiculous markups for \"busy\" times, or \"in demand\" areas, etc. Mind you, we're not talking about a measly 50 cent or so surcharge, they actually double the estimate rate on many occasions. One day without paying attention you might end up having to pay $80 for what you've taken at a rate $40 on several occasions only because there were quite a few people requesting other drivers in that area at once. Seriously??  _x000D_The support is a complete joke. At least when I call a CC or my bank support, although I'm getting someone from Thailand or Singapore, someone actually picks up the phone. Uber doesn't even have a number! This is a company valued in the billions. Again...Seriously??_x000D_After you send the email for a charge dispute, they are very polite in telling you \"NO, our calculations are correct at present rider rates.\" -Um NO, they're not if the more expensive rate setting alternative is cheaper._x000D_Folks, don't fall for the \"trend\" of using Uber because many others are. Trend setters will wait on line for 3hrs to get a muffin because so and so celebrity gets their pastries there. Yea I know...really stupid. So don't be one of those. Plenty of alternative car services in this big city that'll actually pick you up with a SET rate to give you before they even come. _x000D_Otherwise, the yellow cabbies are still cheaper.  No matter what BS marketing they try to pass you.\n",
      "I have had some terrible experiences with the uber cab drivers. They are terrible with directions and they are extremely arrogant. _x000D_Once a driver asked me to get off the cab because he thought I gave the wrong pick up address. And in another instance, the driver shouted at me because I told him to take a specific route. I have had many such experiences and so have my family members.._x000D_If anyone faces an issue like this, please take them directly to the police station. I regret not doing that myself..\n",
      "I tried to use Uber for the first time today and what a joke. The Android App is the most amateur and unusable app I've ever seen. Seriously. Who designed it? It is completely not logical, follows few if any standards, completely non-intuitive. I seriously wonder if you need to take drugs to understand how to use it. I'm not even joking. Head meds, crack cocaine - something. The website is even worse. The absolutely least user friendly and non-functional website I have ever seen from a company larger than 5 employees. What's up with that? Then, if you get through all of that, which takes a roughly 2 hour learning curve because the app makes no sense until you start trying random things - it only accepts certain KINDS of credit cards. It wants bank cards so it can presumably drain your bank account at will, but rejects secure cards that limit the damage criminal companies like Uber can do. That's nice.\n",
      "We noticed UBER charges on our credit card for rides we did not take. Found out that we could not call UBER to notify them, only email. After 5 days of back and forth emails with 10 different 'customer service' people, during which time fraud charges were continuing with UBER (and we had cancelled the AMEX, which is strange)... UBER finally told us that a MISS MOM was using our account, or created their own account with our card. The ONLY fraud charges with the card were with UBER. They gave us zero peace of mind with their security systems with credit card information, basically we got the sense that there is NO security and they have NO sense of urgency when it comes to fraudulent credit card use. Luckily we have fraud protection with AMEX even though UBER will still try to hold us liable...Obviously Going to Lyft now.....UBER IS HORRIBLE\n",
      "I was charged a 4.7 times surcharge _x000D_Now i'm trying to resolve this with Uber customer service and what a joke_x000D_It's like being trapped in an endless circle._x000D_I will not use them again and I will not recommend Uber to anyone\n",
      "Uber, a company valued at 61 billion dollars. Uber is very popular with their riders. The reason uber is so loved by their riders is because a uber ride is about 1/3rd the price of a taxi._x000D_A uber rider can pay a minimum of $4.80 for a ride. A taxi would charge around $10.00 for the same ride.. A uber driver will average 10 minutes to go pick up a rider and take the rider to their destination and drop them off. Uber driver ends the trip and uber instantly displays how much the driver is paid, $2.40 for the trip. The trip will take around 30 minutes of your time. Now the driver has to pay for their gas, insurance, wear and tear  on their vehicle. After the driver figures in the expenses, he or she is left with a profit of zero!!_x000D_I have drove for uber part time for 2 years plus. In the beginning I easily made $350.00 a week. Now I average $75.00 a week and drive twice the miles to make that. Uber has not sent my 2015 1099's to report the income to the IRS. When you email uber about a problem, you will receive a robot answer. Uber does not care about their drivers. Uber only cares about increasing their $61 billion dollar value to $81 billion. I am a retired man and my advice to anyone who is considering driving for uber is......DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! You will be better off flipping burgers at McDonalds.\n",
      "UberPOOL is a total scam and as a matter of fact, I think the algorithm is totally off in many cases. UberPOOL would charge me more than a UberX for exactly the same route during the same time of a week and the only difference is POOL wasted me twice the time for picking up the second passenger from THE AIRPORT, where we had to drive in and wait and pick up the other passenger from one of the terminals. I tried contacting customer service FIVE TIMES because it made no sense to me at all and I doubt whether any of the customer support people had any sense how the product actually works or even how to read at all, because none of them ever answered my question and instead just said very random and useless things to me. Dear Uber, please at least spend some money training your people because they made your company look very stupid and unprofessional. And to NYC passengers, take the yellow cab because they are at least registered officially and the pricing is transparent.\n",
      "I was with family coming back home after shopping. We called uber the first time ever. The driver probably was drunk. He took totally a wrong route and when we said it's wrong he said he has to follow the directions which were shown on his uber device. He just kept driving and suddenly we found our selves on highway. I got worried and ask him to call some one he said he can't do that. He was driving so rough and just kept going on the highway. We asked him to just stop and let us go but he said he can't coz he won't get paid then. At last we have to tell him that if he doesn't stop we will call 911. He just suddenly applied the breaks and we escaped the accident by mere inches. Finally he let us got off whrn we said we will pay him in cash and we realized we were in some different city. We took a taxi and came home. Uber charged us the extra fare and the trip cost us 130 $ what would have been just 12-15$. The worst and scariest experience of my life. So please just be careful as anyone can register with uber so you never know who you gonna trust.\n",
      "My girlfriend use this frequently but every single time that I used this service I had bad experiences. Usually the drivers don't know the city at all and they always take the longest route, in order to charge the maximum fare._x000D_Also, I have bad experience dealing with rude drivers.\n",
      "I found this morning that I was charged almost $40 for a ride I did not take. At 10PM last night I was sleeping. I have been told to go through Support email to get this resolved but I have not been replied  and I have now been disabled from the system and to get back on I have to go through Support which is exactly the email I have not been replied from. FU@&! these people. I spend at least $200/mth with these fools and have a 5 Star rating.. Hello Lyft!\n",
      "The second email said if you do not use it you will lose it. So we decided to use it from Hollywood Beach Fl to Miami Beach Fl this past Saturday afternoon. Then our card was charged and it did not have the discount removed from bill. I wrote them since there is no telephone to call. I sent many emails with copies of the promotional email they sent twice. Every response was from different person and each response said that the promotion was already used in Nov 2015 for my account. I wrote how can that be when the two emails from your Company were dated Feb 18 2016 and March 21 2016? No response except to repeat that we do not get the $20 off this charge.\n",
      "The driver drove me a distance of what would have been a $10 cab ride and charged $35.00 and that's not the worst part.  He tried to charge my credit card $1850.00 and $1200.00. Luckily Discover card caught it, flagged it and denied it.  The charge was attempted through a company called Lavish Limos.\n",

      "After a night out got a taxi through uber at normal rate twice and both times said on route but then cancelled the pick up for no reason? Then the price surge occurred and we were picked up and dropped off meaning a Â£25-30 dare then became over Â£60 customer support not existant uber is dreadful company to deal with\n",
      "Uber cab service is pathetic in India & you'll feel cheated everytime you travel with them. They will charge cancellation fee of Rs. 80 everytime the booking is cancelled by the cab driver due to his own reasons. Their so called promo codes never work and after paying the driver you have to lodge a written complain through your mail id or Uber app to resolve the issues and this normally takes between 24-72 hours to get resolved. Uber will refund the money and credit it in your uber account, so to use that you again have to book a cab. This is how uber forcefully tries to retain their customers._x000D_The drivers are unprofessional. Customer support too is very poor in India. Their app is not up to the mark and multiple issues arise during payment.\n",
      "Right after I left the car I realize I left my important school supplies there and called when the driver was still literally down the street and didn't pick up any off my calls. I left a voicemail and Uber didn't even help.\n",
      "Normal Taxi fare from my home to airport is $25.  I was struggling with Windows app on my new Windows phone, and it was my first use of the app on my new phone._x000D_I was not quoted the fare price before agreeing to pay the surcharge, which I did under duress, as I was running late due to faulty phone app... it would not even accept my home address as pickup location, kept changing it.  I did not have time to request a taxi, so I agreed to pay under duress.  I request a partial refund from customer service and they said no.  Many reviews of their Windows app are negative.  I also give a negative review of their customer service.\n",
      "Uber seemed to be ideal since I just moved back home to Columbus, and I'm a single full time parent.  Uber's App sent me to fictitious addresses, wrong addresses, and  refused to accept responsibility for the wasted time, fuel, and deficiencies of their own App.  _x000D_The passengers constantly complained to me about the App's functionality, and the inability of contacting Uber Customer Support._x000D_The cost of driving for Uber is too high.  Car payment, fuel, oil changes, Uber Fee, and Passenger Fee, leaves minimum wages for the driver.  While Uber claims that drivers can make great money, it's actually Uber that is making \"great\" money!!_x000D_Charging drivers high fees on top of maintenance costs of their own vehicles is ridiculous!\n",
      "My experiences are mixed, with a couple of good rides, but on the whole were negative. Actual experiences: Bad - surge pricing has no upper limit. A trip which normally costs about $20 ended up costing almost $150 due to Uber's uncapped surge pricing policy. Uber has no city or government limit on prices, meaning that they can pretty much gouge what they want, as opposed to taxis who have rates limited by law. Often the surge pricing does not reflect the reality of what the demand and cost actually are out in the streets, extending beyond the actual \"surge\" in demand in order to add a little extra.\n",
      "I used Uber from Sky Harbor airport. First a UberX got wrong address and called from nowhere after 10 minutes and asked me cancel trip since she went to wrong address and far away from me, Uber charged me 5 dollars for cancellation and unexpected. Second time Uber directed me to select UberSelect and got the driver. He was late, before I took his car I asked the price and he said he is Uber SELECT and it cost 60 USD to my home. I go to Sky Harbor very frequently and it is exactly 30 miles from my home. He took the longest route and charged 95 USD for 38 miles. Will never take UberSelect, or Black or SUV... They have a base charge, charge/mile and then the charge for time, a complete rip off\n",

      "I've been driving and riding with Uber for 3 months and I have completed about 500 trips. Overall, my experience has been very good. I don't like Uber's rating system...which allows angry, depressed, and drunk people an opportunity to rate you poorly. The pay is crappy. Net of expenses I might make minimum wage. My last trip was 3.2 miles, 10 minutes. I made 5.18. I have done 5 trips in Boise, been online 5.5 hrs. and made 23.48. (Tues) That's it._x000D_That's the downside. The upside is that I work when I want with no micro manager looking over me. 95% of the passengers are excellent, decent people. It's always the 5% that cause all of the problems. Vaping, sneaking drinks in the car, screaming and yelling. I had a kid call me a cracker. So there's always that._x000D_I read a lot of the reviews on this page. Some ring true, some I think are complete BS. The passengers I talk to (virtually all of them) love Uber. One guy told me he cannot afford to own a car- he simply Ubers everywhere and saves the expense. He uses Uber 40 times a month which costs him 200-250 or about half the cost of a car, insurance, gas, and oil. _x000D_There is nothing wrong with Uber. It's just another capitalistic, greedy corporation which is going to try and sweep every last crumb off the table. This should be nothing new to drivers and riders who have lived in America the last 40 years.\n",
      "I have enjoyed Uber until 03/14/2016. Now I'm done. I'm at a Marriott in DC. Driver calls and asks where I am. I'm in front. He says no you're not. He realizes he is not at the front entrance and tells me to walk around back. I said no. He said then cancel the trip. I cancelled, rebooked, the same driver took the route! I cancelled again and took a taxi. Uber charged me $5 each for the cancellations. YOU CAN NOT CONTACT ANYONE WITH UBER. It was easy to get a credit, but not a refund. YOU STEAL MY MONEY AND GIVE ME A CREDIT! Never again Uber. I will never use Uber again.\n",
      "I had a Uber driver pick me up at a restaurant in Chicago and requested a ride to hotel, only 2 miles away. Since I was a tourist I had no idea how to get to my hotel and neither did my driver. He didn't know English or how to use MapQuest. He drove around for 20 minutes in a circle. I had to get on my iPhone and give him the instructions to get to Chicago O'hare Sheraton. And since he got lost, I got charged $30!!! On paper, Uber sounds like a good idea, but in reality it doesn't work. The drivers are not trained well, their cars are dirty, they are just jumping from fare to fare without any regard to the customers. Uber is a hot mess.\n",
      "I do not user. My business partner does. Last week in LA I agreed to let her get an Uber to take us to the airport.  We saw the car pass the location once and I said, \"We're in trouble already.\"  The driver came around the block.  Pulled up.  We had a lot of bags.  He didn't lift a finger to help.  After loading the trunk I got in the rear passenger side door.  While sitting there waiting for my partner to get in the other door I saw him put the car into Drive.  I almost said something thinking to myself this guy wouldn't start going before everyone was in the car.  WRONG.  HE STARTED ROLLING.  LUCKILY MY PARTNER, WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS NOT.  He stopped the car.  I said, 'We're out of here.'  Once again, surprise, surprise he didn't help us take anything out.  UBER IS DANGEROUS.  THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL.  THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO KNOW ANYTHING (ALWAYS RELYING ON THEIR PHONE MAPPING APS) AND THEY DON'T CARRY ANY MORE INSURANCE THAN A NORMAL DRIVER.  This situation ended okay, although stressful.  But the next time....\n",
      "I schefuled a pickup on Miami Beach waited much longer than was quoted on the map. The map kept changing time to a longer period.  After a while I called the driver to see where he was and he said in Spanish that he didn't speak English. I canceled the trip and tried to schedule another and the price went from $16 to $43. I called Central taxi and had a car in 3 minutes for less money. I seriously doubt I'll use Uber again.\n",
      "When I started driving UBER, on the surface it looked good. It became very obvious, very faster than obvious, what UBER is really about, NOT: \"Delivering Quality Rides\"!_x000D_UBER is to deliver cheap, fast transportation, on the costs of its drivers, by allowing every dumb*** to rate the professionalism of Drivers. And what is that?_x000D_Putting up with a rider's:_x000D_- dumb comments_x000D_- insults_x000D_- arrogance_x000D_- unfair demands_x000D_- demand to break traffic rules_x000D_- impatience_x000D_and then still feed the rider with free sweets, drinks and accept to receive a low rating because you didn't look like the rider would have wished you look like, etc.,_x000D_Very professional, UBER. Now go to hell._x000D_UBER will end up with the low of low. But that wouldn't place a scratch mark on UBER's executives. By then they will have made their millions and thus, who cares?\n",
      "I called over for the first time is to get a ride from Minneapolis-St. Paul airport to a local home in Mendota Heights. I had done this route before via taxi and was charged $18. Over estimated fare was $22-$32. I canceled the Uber driver after he called me several times and texted me. I thought it was supposed be cheaper than other taxis.\n",
      "I wont ever use uber again, they are very unprofessional and high who ever the hell they want. just recently my friend used an uber to go to her boyfriends when she go in the uber her uber driver asked her if she wanted some water, she said yes. he grabbed some water from the front seat opening it for her. the next thing she knew he turned off the meter and told her it would be free of charge...... the end of the night she was in the hospital getting a rape test done that came back positive.... this uber driver date rape drugged her water and raped her.  DONT USE UBER\n",
      "Do not use Uber!!! I used Uber almost every day for the past 6 months and this past Friday I was charged $58 for a $8 ride!! The driver reported that I spilled something in her backseat. Upon me entering the car I told the driver that there was a little spill and she replied \"It's ok I have napkins upfront\". There wasn't a letter or email to inform me that an additional $50 was being extracted from my account. I am a student and that money was for my senior dues, smh. Thanks Uber!!! STAY AWAY FROM UBER. USE LYFT THEY ARE MORE AFFORDABLE THAN UBER AND YOU FREE RIDES!!! If you do use Uber keep track of your account so they don't rob you like they robbed me.\n",
      "Worst company to work for lets say you get a minimum fare in N.J. which is $5.60 Uber automatically takes a $1.60 for safe trip why they take this when your the driver providing the safe trip now where down to $4 then they take there 25% now we have a whopping $3 deduct your gas, car payments & insurance you might be left with $2 so your putting your car on the road and the only people making money is Uber, at your expense stay away go work in Burger King or Mc Donalds you will be financially better of.\n",
      "My first ride with Uber went like this. The driver asked me what time my flight was. Naturally I wanted to get there early to check in beat the traffic and to make sure I would get through security on time. My Uber driver took that opportunity to drive around the suburbs to hike up the fare. so he could run into traffic. A 45 minute trip took 1.5 hours. I only made my flight because I sprinted through the airport. Uber sucks\n",
      "I was so excited to work for uber got a nice new car been driving now for 2 months but every nirte I come home so depressed I make about 6 bucks an hour pay for gas please do not be a driver I do not drive for uber any more some one is making big bucks but NOT THE DRIVERS\n",
      "I am a Cr England truck driver my truck needed service, and I was stranded uber driver picked me up and got me to my yard safty for a reasonable price thank you be safe out there drivers.\n",
      "My sister and I had a quick ride from one bar to another on Saturday night in LA County. The driver dropped us off right by the bouncer who can confirm that neither of us was drunk and driver didn't have any interaction with us when we were leaving/expressed concerns. We had no liquid on us as well (if it is a spill). Later I found out that I was charged $200 cleaning fee. I reached out to Uber who sent me a picture of the wet seat. This mess does not belong to me however Uber still charged me a cleaning fee. They trust their driver but not their customers. I strongly believe that it is the way for Moustafa (my driver) retaliated against me because he believed that I would give him poor ratings since we had an unpleasant talk that night. Earlier that night he picked up wrong people and made me wait for over 20 minutes to come back pick me up. This driver is lying.\n",
      "I use both Uber and Lyft occasionally and have found both services very convenient. However I think Lyft does a better job of screening their drivers. A recent ride with Robert on 2/16/16 started out fine then he aggressively began to proselytize and ask me if I would accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior. I was trapped for the ride and he was on the freeway speeding and weaving on the road. I began to pray that's for sure! I let him talk so I could get home and have him drop me off a block away from my house. Never again for Uber!!\n",
      "I\"m new to Uber 2 weeks.  It's bad.  Bad app, bad gps, bad pay.  $9.00 and hour before taxes, gas, insurance, fuel, ware and tare on your car.  The fact that the owner is a multimillionaire and he pays drivers $2.18 to drive across the city is just another capitalist.  You'll spend most of your time driving around the block looking for someone who is 1/4 mile away.   Shame on uber.  #Bernie\n",
      "My wallet was stolen out of an uber last night with my social security card inside and this was the message I sent over 4 hours ago and have yet to recieve a response. I seriously question the legitimacy of this company and strongly advise people not to use the app. I have been a big fan for almost two years but I truly believe there is an underlying issue with this company. Any other customer support system would be much more attentive to the matter and have consideration to help their customers with their best interest in mind. _x000D_To Uber customer support: _x000D_I received an unusual phone call from your company this afternoon that made me so uncomfortable that I had to hang up. The man on the phone had a hard time speaking clear English and said that he had contacted the driver but failed to Answer any questions pertaining to the wallet, even when asked directly. The phone call seemed like it was coming from over seas. Unless it was a mock phone call, it has made me begin to question the legitimacy of your company. I have spoken with a lawyer, the police, an investigator, and the attorney general's office. Further action on this matter will be addressed within the next few days because your customer service has failed to make the slightest advancement in helping me. I have been in contact with you for the past 8 hours and have yet to receive the smallest details about my driver, such as his last name, despite the fact that your employee has committed a felony against one of your customers. I am extremely disappointed and will continue to inform everyone I know of this situation and the how unprofessionally it has been handled.\n",
      "Took Uber to airport. Driver barely spoke English. He charged me 13.00. Yahoo. Impressive. Dropped me off at a parking lot. I had to walk over a block to airport. The communication with him was horrible!!! Then took it back home from airport to house. With a new non English speaking driver. Who wen I finally got him to go the right way. Got my charge this time 50.73$. WOW!!! \n",
      "Charged me 13$ To get dropped off at airport Could not speak English dropped me off in a parking lot across from airport !! Took uber home from airport got charged 50.73.  It's impossible to contact someon there. And it was my second mom English speaking cabbie. Who's car stunk like yellow cabs. Cabbies.   Frustrated.\n",
      "Makes it near impossible to find a contact option and no number is available. Recently switched their payment method so that PayPal credit is not available. PayPal charged my directly because of Uber.\n",
      "Maurice Heyliger in Atlanta area - THIS IS YOU BUDDY!  Quote a 40 dollar ride and then upcharge to 150+ afterwards.  Nicely done. _x000D_As you can read from the posts this seems to be a standard business practice.  Next time on Shark Tank you can thank that POS Chris Sacca that says he invested in Uber all the time.  This company will eventually fail on its own or be sued into oblivion.\n",
      "Wow! Where do I begin?! I applied to be a driver, I waited, waited, waited&waited some more. I had to contact them in order to find out my status. I don't like giving my info to just anyone. Long story short I was denied&told I should've got my background check. I was given a website to contact the supposed Background company& they couldn't find ANY info on me in their system. MAYBE because I DON'T have much of a criminal background. BUT! You've got this FOOL killing folks for a hobby. REALLY Uber?! Clue me in\n",
      "The first  time  ever in my life that I  used a Uber was for Chi-town for new years  eve which I only got charged only $35 bucks which is a good thing btw when I  was going  back home New Years they didn't have enough drivers on the road sor Uber decided to  surge price me and I ended up  wasting 17th bucka on my debit card. P.S. the drivers aren't  that friendly anyways that's why I switched  to  Lyft which is way better service and  you know your not getting  ripped off with the  amount of  money  your spending on a ride\n",
      "If you are contemplating driving for Uber in NJ, think again....maybe 3x. Ask around. All I know from my experience as a driver for three months with 500 trips under my belt and a 4.8 rating........be very very circumspect before leasing a car. What they do is rope you in as a driver with decent pay for two weeks....then wham.....they cut the fares in half. Let me ask you as a logical human being......can a driver who has usually a car payment of at least $600 per month...plus insurance.....(unless the ins. co finds out you drive for Uber and then presto....drops you like a rusty safe in the river) plus gas, and wear and tear on the car driver 10-15 minutes for $3....well that is the fare they pay. Also if you happen to drive to Manhattan......and they take out $20 for toll and charge the customer.....and then only pay you $8-15 on top of that to drop off the customer before you have to drive through traffic to get back into NJ to accept another fare which usually takes at least an hour....do you think that is a good usage of time and good pay? You see what Uber is doing is trying to show Wall Street (Watch \"The Big Short\"- very appropo for Uber) the huge rider base. The problem is that the drivers are dropping out like flies because they can not afford to drive. I know as I have picked up many ex drivers recounting the same experience. Wall St......which incidentally I used to work for years ago for almost two decades.....is about to have a rude awakening when they see the market valuation Uber claims of $63 bill. -even though they lost over $467 mill in 2015-from a confidential source yours truly picked up devulged-is nothing more than specious and a \"house of cards\". Now Uber's PR will tell you how wonderful it is to slash fares all in order to be more busy for the drivers but don't believe a word they say. It is because they are burning through drivers faster than the INDIE speedway all in order to keep riders happy. Good luck people in your decision but know that you had better do your homework before you get involved in such an exploitive outfit. BE DAMN CAREFUL.\n",
      "We went on vacation to Washington dc...we took uber all over the city for 4 days we had a great experience. They arrived  on time were overly polite and got us to our destination in a safe timely manner..great experience  and would use them again!\n"
